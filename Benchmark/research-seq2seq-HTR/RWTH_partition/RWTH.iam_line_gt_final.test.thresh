m02-048-03,191 little sorry if we were not back for Christmas
m02-048-04,191 as arranged , but he consoled himself by
m02-048-05,191 thinking that he and Angelina would have
m02-048-06,191 plenty of time together in the future . And
m02-048-07,191 Heaven alone knew when , if ever , he would be

n02-004-00,164 To Beryl , at least , this was anti-climax with a
n02-004-01,164 vengeance . She had expected to be met with violent
n02-004-02,164 reproaches - and here he was bland and smiling .
n02-004-03,165 But it did not take her long to realise that his mood
n02-004-04,159 was less pleasant than appeared on the surface .
n02-004-05,162 He told her nonchalantly , as he led the way to his
n02-004-06,162 own veranda , that he had taken the liberty of
n02-004-07,162 asking Jack - as a representative of the Vallin family -
n02-004-08,160 to come over and make the presentation in her stead .
n02-009-00,166 " I caught him just as he was going to the
n02-009-02,164 of fact I 'd asked him last night to deputise

n02-009-06,161 said the first thing that came into her head .
p02-076-00,180 Gay thanked him and walked out on to
p02-076-01,179 the terrace thinking that perhaps Gavin
p02-076-02,179 had bought a drink and taken it outside .
p02-076-03,181 She looked round scanning the tables ,
p02-076-04,179 then caught her breath , a cold hand
p02-076-05,176 seeming to clutch her heart . Gavin was
p02-076-06,179 seated at a small table in a shadowy
p02-076-07,180 corner talking animatedly to Simone .
p02-076-08,177 As Gay watched he offered the girl a
p02-076-09,176 cigarette and lit it , his hands cupping
p02-081-00,182 Gay stood irresolute for a moment , half
p02-081-01,183 decided to go back and join Lilyan and
p02-081-02,182 Doc , while she wanted to do no more than
p02-081-03,179 run upstairs to her room , knowing that
p02-081-04,178 Gavin although he had told her that he
p02-081-05,180 loved her , was already flirting with a girl
p02-081-06,180 that he had only met a few minutes before .
p02-081-08,176 but she turned away , giving a little
p02-081-09,178 gesture of hopelessness , knowing that her
n04-202-00,182 Glad I met you . Don't forget to give me a ring -
n04-202-01,182 any time - knock twice and ask for Bawley , what ? "
n04-202-02,182 " I don't know when that will be , " said John .
n04-202-03,183 " I shall be busy for a while , cleaning up after
n04-202-04,182 Master bloody Munyard . " THERE were six submarines ,
n04-202-05,182 lying in pairs alongside the jetty at Fort Blockhouse .
n04-202-06,182 Black and grimly businesslike they both looked and
n04-202-07,182 sounded , for all of them were rumbling as they
n04-202-08,177 charged their electric batteries .
n04-209-00,183 A light wind wafted the smoke of diesel exhaust in
n04-209-01,182 through the open windows of the Captain's house . It
n04-209-02,182 pervaded every room but neither Harry nor Madeleine
n04-209-03,183 Turton noticed its existence as they sat in silence over
n04-209-04,179 a substantial breakfast . Although usually a very
n04-209-05,182 talkative lady Madeleine respected her husband's
n04-209-06,182 silences , for she knew they betokened a worry of
n04-209-07,183 some sort .
n04-213-00,182 There had been many such breakfasts lately since the
n04-213-01,182 affair of Parsifal . Harry had lost a good deal of weight .
n04-213-02,182 His normal placid and steady-going manner remained ,
n04-213-03,182 but she could see that it no longer came naturally .
n04-213-04,179 It is the common lot of all Squadron Senior Officers
n04-213-05,179 to experience such catastrophes as the loss of a submarine ,
n04-213-06,179 though in peace time these happenings are few and
n04-213-07,179 far between .
n04-218-00,182 This is the testing time for all . The affair blows up into
n04-218-01,182 a national disaster and then when it is all over life
n04-218-02,182 must continue as before . During this period the Captain
n04-218-03,182 must present an unruffled appearance and carry on as
n04-218-04,182 if nothing unusual has happened . Harry Turton had
n04-218-05,179 written letters to the bereaved , had visited many in the
n04-218-06,179 locality , had been interviewed by the Press , had driven
n04-218-07,179 his surviving submarines a good deal harder than
n04-218-08,179 usual and in fact had applied all the usual specifics
n04-218-09,179 suitable for such occasions .
m01-095-00,178 Coming around the great mass of the Chateau
m01-095-01,179 Laurier , he braked to a screeching stop . A
m01-095-02,178 flying saucer was tilting and dipping over
m01-095-03,179 the War Memorial . There was a deep
m01-095-05,175 overtone that sang in his ears with an
m01-095-06,178 almost painful sharpness . He reversed and
m01-095-07,178 turned back on McKenzie Avenue .
g01-031-00,152 Social service as a function of government
g01-031-01,152 was quite alien to mediaeval thought - its
g01-031-03,152 communities , whether those communities were
g01-031-04,147 monasteries , manors , townships , or wards and
g01-031-05,149 guilds of a city . A mediaeval tax was
g01-031-06,152 therefore in essence a forced payment whose
g01-031-07,152 return was the uncertain bounty of booty
g01-031-08,149 and the vague advantages of military glory ;
g01-031-09,149 it was therefore always granted grudgingly
g01-031-10,153 and coupled with the vain hope that , in the
g01-034-00,153 When ' his ' war did not bring victory and
g01-034-01,153 booty , a new group of Lords might oust
g01-034-02,153 the unsuccessful leaders , and the Commons ,
g01-034-03,151 who usually supplied the hard cash , might
g01-034-04,148 be bold enough to demand the production of
g01-034-05,148 accounts , and even at times the impeachment of
g01-034-06,151 the unsuccessful . But the Commons were not
g01-034-07,151 the people , and even a full Parliament was
g01-034-08,146 not yet a true mirror of the nation .
g01-037-00,149 The people - Langland's ' folk ' and Gaunt's
g01-037-01,149 ' knaves ' - were villeins still tied to the
g01-037-02,149 feudal obligations of work or villeins who
g01-037-03,148 had bought their release , free labourers
g01-037-04,145 who worked for the highest bidders , free
g01-037-05,144 yeomen who had prospered enough to become
g01-037-06,148 successful farmers , the artisans , craftsmen ,
g01-037-07,148 journeymen and small tradesmen of the
g01-037-08,144 towns , and the retainers and men-at-arms
g01-037-09,146 in the pay of landed Lords .
m01-136-00,176 His whole attitude was a mixture of
m01-136-01,178 impatience pending an awaited
m01-136-02,177 communication and of a vague
m01-136-03,174 perplexity respecting his surroundings
m01-136-04,172 and the purpose he was to serve .
m01-136-06,174 Heather and Steve tried to make themselves

g03-052-04,191 mined and obdurate in their attitude that
g03-052-05,193 their candidate must go forward in the
g03-052-06,194 elections . In the Sheffield Trades and Labour
g03-052-07,194 Council meeting on October 16 , 1912 , George

d06-060-00,163 One of the greatest steps forward that has been
d06-060-01,161 made this century is the way in which illness
d06-060-02,164 of the mind is no longer feared or shunned ,
d06-060-03,163 and is in fact no differently regarded than
d06-060-04,162 physical illness . There is , nevertheless , a
d06-060-05,162 great deal of tiredness which comes from
d06-060-06,160 no major complication but results from an
d06-060-07,161 inability to deal with life , especially under

d05-008-00,168 The new century opened with James 1 ascending
d05-008-01,168 the throne . He was quite prepared to be
d05-008-02,167 tolerant towards Rome though the Gunpowder Plot
d05-008-03,168 spoiled that . The Puritans had high hopes , for
d05-008-04,165 James had grown up in Presbyterian Scotland ,
d05-008-05,166 but those hopes were dashed . True , a new Prayer
d05-008-06,166 Book was issued in 1604 but the Puritans
d05-008-07,166 derived little comfort from it .
d05-021-00,161 This indicated how ephemeral in the Church had
d05-021-01,165 been the mood which produced the Black Rubric , for
d05-021-02,168 it says that ' the Body and Blood of Christ , which are
d05-021-05,172 definite . It was at this time , too , that King James made
d05-021-07,176 a Bible translation - the Authorized Version
d05-025-00,167 In that year Shakespeare had just turned
d05-025-01,167 forty and had written Hamlet two years
d05-025-02,167 before . Bacon was at work and Milton was
d05-025-03,167 just learning to read . James was followed by
d05-025-04,167 Charles , in whose reign came the Scottish
d05-025-05,165 Prayer Book in 1637 . Significantly this made
d05-025-06,165 a deliberate return to the Book of 1549 and
d05-025-07,165 became the foster mother of some of the most
d05-025-08,163 important Prayer Books in the Anglican
d05-025-09,163 Communion .
d05-030-00,166 Forever associated with Charles is Archbishop Laud ,
d05-030-01,168 now so much nobler a figure than former historians
d05-030-02,168 led us to believe . Laud was enthusiastically hated
d05-030-03,168 by Calvinists and Puritans , and the sentiment was
d05-030-04,166 mutual . But Laud was no Romanizer . One of his
d05-030-05,166 first public acts was a hard-hitting battle with
d05-030-06,168 the Jesuit , Fisher . But anyone who was friendly
d05-030-07,166 with James and Charles , the Puritans argued ,
d05-030-08,163 was necessarily a menace .
g04-043-00,180 But what a change from the dear little old church
g04-043-01,184 at Tatsfield to the great modern church of St. Mark's
g04-043-02,182 at Purley . One felt at Tatsfield that , small as the
g04-043-04,182 had been a House of Prayer . I could not but feel the
g04-043-05,184 chilliness of the new church , beautiful as it was and is .
g04-043-06,185 When we had found a group of people who gladly
g04-043-07,182 co-operated , we made the little side chapel a place
g04-043-08,178 of daily prayer .
g04-048-00,178 I suggested to the congregation that it needed
g04-048-01,178 warming up by constant prayer and worship , and we
g04-048-02,182 found many to help . Gifts of candlesticks and
g04-048-03,179 stained-glass lancet windows - finally a new altar -
g04-048-04,178 helped to furnish the chapel as a little sanctuary
g04-048-05,177 for prayer and quiet . In time we received similar
g04-048-07,176 windows .
n04-130-01,166 off it , " said Bawley . " The proprietor of the Daily
n04-130-02,166 Courier knows what 's going on . If he doesn't mind ,
n04-130-03,166 why should you ? " " I see . " John took the
n04-130-04,163 refilled glass and looked over the rim at his
n04-130-05,163 companion . " You want me to talk , is that it ? "
n04-139-00,169 " You misjudge me , " said Bawley . " You have
n04-139-05,165 of course . " " On one condition , " said John .
n04-149-02,166 we give him the publicity . ' The Honourable
n04-149-04,168 sort of thing . " " You 'll get nothing out of me , "

n04-156-04,166 host and a splendid raconteur . The evening
n04-156-05,166 passed all too quickly . As they parted in
n04-156-06,165 the vestibule the two men were well
n04-156-07,166 disposed towards each other .
n04-163-02,166 give me a ring at this number and I 'll
n04-163-05,165 John took it and put it in his pocket .

g04-022-02,149 1924 I was in a different parish in Surrey .
g04-022-03,149 Towards the end of my five and a half years'
g04-022-04,149 incumbency I was asked if I would start
g04-022-05,148 a village choral society and conduct it .
g04-022-06,145 This opened up a new interest , and we plunged
g04-022-07,146 into it .
n06-074-00,179 He rode down to where I was waiting . I was
n06-074-01,180 thinking what a skill he had for reading
n06-074-02,180 my mind . " This would be as good a place
n06-074-04,180 near me . " Yes , " I said . " It 'll be here to-
n06-074-05,180 morrow as likely as not . " I paused . " Miss
n06-074-06,179 Jeannie 'll be on that coach , Dan . "
n06-082-00,180 " Yes , " he said . " I know . " " No harm must come
n06-082-02,181 men who 'll be after that coach I 'm interested
n06-082-03,179 in , Johnny . " " I know . But if lead starts
n06-082-05,178 But I reckon they 'll be too busy shooting at
n06-082-06,177 us to bother with the coach and the folks
n06-082-07,177 in it . "
n06-092-00,181 " Maybe , " I said . " But we 've got to remember
n06-092-01,181 that girl all the time , Dan . I feel kind
n06-092-02,181 of responsible for her . " " Of course , " he said ,
n06-092-03,180 giving me one of his strange looks . Then he
n06-092-05,181 and have a look at the mining camp .
n06-092-07,182 working for , as well as the townsfolk and
n06-092-08,179 the agency detective . "
n06-100-00,180 With something of a start I remembered the
n06-100-01,179 man who 'd brought us into this business .
n06-100-02,179 " Maybe you don't know about Appleton ,
n06-100-04,179 I said . I watched him because I was always
n06-100-05,178 fascinated by the way he looked when you
n06-100-06,178 tried to surprise him . " Dead ? " he said . " Yes .
n06-100-07,177 Dead . Shuffled out of the deck . Blasted
n06-100-08,176 down with a shotgun outside the Palace
n06-100-09,176 last night . "
n06-111-00,180 " Fenton or Somers , " he said . " Or the Town
n06-111-01,181 Marshal , " I added . His face was fixed ,
n06-111-04,181 his horse back off the trail and up the slope
n06-111-05,178 leading to the ridge . I followed . From the
n06-111-06,180 top you could see something of the wild hill
n06-111-07,179 country that lay all round Gilburg Crossing .
n06-119-00,178 The air was fresh and clear and you
n06-119-01,181 could see far over west and north for many
n06-119-02,179 miles . The real high country of the Rockies
n06-119-03,179 lifted up in the distance like a pale water-
n06-119-04,181 colour drawing . Between us and that lay
n06-119-05,178 a vast stretch of hills , canyons , buttes and
n06-119-06,178 malpais .
n06-123-01,181 said Dan . " If we head west we ought to
n06-123-02,180 cut the trail leading from Gilburg to the north . "
n06-123-03,182 So we swung west , making slow going over
n06-123-04,181 rough country , sliding on shale , climbing down
n06-123-05,178 into draws , circling a big mesa by a
n06-123-06,180 four or five mile valley , sandy-floored . It
n06-123-07,179 got hotter as the day wore on and we rested
n06-123-08,179 gratefully by a small creek where we watered
n06-123-09,178 the horses and drank enough to cure our
n06-123-10,175 thirst .
n06-128-00,178 An hour's riding brought us to a trail that
n06-128-02,179 We turned north into it and after about four
n06-128-03,179 miles it led into a small canyon which
n06-128-04,179 opened out into a wide shallow draw .
n06-128-05,179 Here in a dried-up creek-bed we found
n06-128-06,178 the miners at work . They were scattered
n06-128-07,179 over a fairly wide area working singly or
n06-133-01,182 of the diggings there was a roughly-built
n06-133-02,180 shack and as we got near someone inside bawled
n06-133-03,180 out , " If you come any closer , I 'll sure blow
n06-133-04,179 your whiskers off . " " Take it easy , mister , " I sang
n06-133-06,178 got no whiskers so as you can see . Just you
n06-133-07,179 go and tell Nick Dowd we 've come to talk
n06-133-08,180 to him about what happened last night . "
n06-140-01,178 whistle then , loud and shrill . The gun barrel
n06-140-02,179 peeking out through a hole in the shack never
n06-140-03,179 wavered . We sat our horses , waiting . " Looks as
n06-140-04,179 though they 're expecting trouble , " I said . " Where
n06-140-06,178 observed Dan , shifting about in his saddle . He
n06-140-07,179 was never long on patience .
g02-073-00,182 ' And while the heart is slowly dying ,
g02-073-03,182 three auricular beats , produce a single
n01-000-00,190 Alastair was a bachelor . All his life he had
n01-000-01,190 been inclined to regard women as something
n01-000-02,191 which must necessarily be subordinated to his
n01-000-03,190 career . Now he realised that he was entrusting not only
n01-000-04,190 his own life , but Geoffrey's as well , to a strange girl
n01-000-05,187 whom he had never met and on whom after no more
n01-000-06,189 than a couple of telephone calls he was
n01-009-02,186 evening - and I shall look forward to meeting you
n01-009-03,186 both at midnight . " They might have been
n01-009-04,184 arranging a supper party . Then she rang off .
n01-009-05,181 Alastair admitted that never in a not altogether
n01-009-06,185 uneventful life had he come across a girl who
n01-009-07,186 sounded so charming and appeared to be so
n01-009-08,182 efficient .
m03-110-00,187 Sally and of course Mrs Septimus , for surely
m03-110-01,186 Mr Septimus stood in the same case as
m03-110-02,186 myself ? But was it so ? I allowed myself
m03-110-03,187 to entertain for an instant the idea , the
m03-110-06,187 would be inopportune ; and with the idea came
m03-110-08,187 to watch Mr Septimus more closely , Mrs
m03-110-09,187 Caine too and Mr Gilberto who would ...
m03-114-00,187 But all three were to the casual
m03-114-01,185 observation I permitted myself unruffled ;
m03-114-02,184 Mr Septimus reserved and certainly very
m03-114-03,185 thoughtful , but that was his habit . Indeed
m03-114-04,183 we were all invaded by a most tranquil
m03-114-05,185 mood . Even the Indian servants relaxed , knowing ,
m03-114-06,186 so Mr Gilberto told us , that the wild and
m03-114-07,185 savage tribes never approached this region : at
m03-114-08,185 any rate they remained with us , perhaps
m03-114-09,187 for such protection as our presence , or Mrs
n02-154-00,181 And then she received a jolt . Old Hubert , standing
n02-154-01,182 beside her , his battered hat in his hand , his
n02-154-02,181 toothless mouth stretched in a wide grin , told her
n02-154-03,182 in halting 6patois that " 3Mistah Piers " had
n02-154-04,175 explained right at the start that " 3Mis' Beryl "
n01-020-00,172 For some reason the orderlies had forgotten
n01-020-01,172 to switch on the lights ; there was no colour -
n01-020-02,172 physical features were distinguishable solely by
n01-020-03,173 gradations of silvery greyness . Even the snow-
n01-020-04,168 capped summit of Mont Blanc , seven miles
n01-020-05,167 below , was not recognisable among the host
n01-020-06,172 of lower peaks . The screen of the air-to-air
n01-020-07,171 radar glowed . Occasionally minute spots
n01-020-08,171 flickered across its surface , but there was
n01-031-00,171 In the exceptional clarity he was even able to
n01-031-01,170 make a direct comparison between the radar
n01-031-02,170 image and the ground itself . Ahead lay the
n01-031-03,170 Plain of Lombardy ; to the right , Turin ; to the
n01-031-04,167 left , Milan . The directional angle of the
n01-031-05,168 scanner could be adjusted to cover any
n01-031-06,170 particular area within its range . Geoffrey
n01-031-08,167 ground immediately ahead .
n01-045-00,173 Now , as Alastair reduced the thrust , the
n01-045-01,174 pitch changed as the nose of the aircraft
n01-045-02,172 dipped slightly . The needle of the speed
n01-045-04,173 before coming to rest at 5.0 . " We 're a bit
n01-045-07,171 smiled . Alastair talked of running in when
n01-045-08,169 they were still more than four hundred
n01-045-09,169 miles from their destination .
f04-053-00,171 And so the inquest , which had dragged on , with
f04-053-01,173 adjournments , until April 7 , finally had to be content to return
f04-053-02,171 a verdict of " wilful murder against some person or
f04-053-03,169 persons unknown . " The most vital clue of the Wedgwood
f04-053-05,169 have been very thankful that the science of
f04-053-06,170 dactyloscopy was only in its beginnings .
f04-057-00,169 The next female fatality occurred eight years later ,
f04-057-01,166 yet so strange were the circumstances that it was
f04-057-02,167 a further seven years before even a ghost of a
f04-057-03,165 solution emerged . There has always been something
f04-057-04,164 sinister in the idea of tunnels . The building of
f04-057-05,166 them was one of the most dangerous jobs con-
f04-057-06,170 nected with railway construction ; and there
f04-057-07,168 were many people who believed that to travel
f04-057-08,163 through tunnels would be an equally
f04-057-09,163 hazardous business .
d07-082-00,173 ( Actually , the Mishnah quotes two further proof
d07-082-01,174 texts and the Gemara explains why these ,
d07-082-02,173 too , are necessary , but a careful examination
d07-082-03,174 of that passage makes it clear that these are
d07-082-04,173 not quoted here because they are not
d07-082-05,171 necessary to prove the point made by
d07-082-06,171 R. Joshua b. Levi . ) Finally , we note that
d07-082-07,172 the comment of Rami bar Rabh is quoted
d07-082-08,169 elsewhere .
d07-085-00,173 From the above it follows that here , once again ,
d07-085-01,172 we have a good illustration of how a
d07-085-02,173 sugya has been fashioned from material
d07-085-03,173 already in the hands of the Redactors .
d07-085-04,173 The sugya is built around the saying of
d07-085-05,170 R. Joshua b. Levi . The proof text for the
d07-085-06,172 reading of the Book of Esther is quoted
d07-085-07,173 with the comment given by Samuel .
d07-089-01,173 known comment on the verse ; quoted by
d07-089-02,173 Samuel in support of his thesis and quoted
d07-089-03,173 by the Gemara in support of R. Joshua b.
d07-089-04,171 Levi's thesis ! ) The proof text of greeting by
d07-089-05,170 the divine Name is taken from the Mishnah .
d07-089-06,169 There is no reference to the Mishnah here
d07-089-07,172 because the Mishnah deals with the
d07-089-08,173 actual practice of greeting by the divine
d07-089-09,171 Name and the Gemara here quotes the
d07-089-10,169 texts to support the thesis of R. Joshua b. Levi .
d07-093-00,174 The question and answer with regard to the
d07-093-01,175 need for the text of the angel are quoted
d07-093-02,173 here in the same words in which they are
d07-093-03,174 quoted in the discussion on the Mishnah .
d07-093-04,171 This can either mean that both sugyas are
d07-093-06,172 answer or that our sugya is quoting from
d07-093-07,172 the longer sugya which deals with all
d07-093-08,171 four texts quoted in the Mishnah .
d07-096-00,176 Or it is possible that our sugya contains the
d07-096-01,176 original question and answer and this is quoted
d07-096-02,173 in the other sugya . ( This can be supported by the
d07-096-04,174 accord but there was no approval of his action
d07-096-06,173 expression appears to have been framed in
d07-096-08,170 whether the Heavenly Court concurred
d07-100-00,173 The proof text of bringing the tithe to the Temple
d07-100-01,171 is then quoted and the interpretation of the
d07-100-02,172 latter part of the verse by Rami bar Rabh
d07-100-03,174 is added , not because this is at all relevant
d07-100-05,172 a familiar interpretation which had
d07-100-06,172 become so well known that it was
d07-100-07,171 invariably quoted whenever the verse
d07-100-08,171 itself was quoted , almost as if it were a
d07-100-09,170 part of the verse .
d07-102-00,172 The Gemara continues with a saying of the
d07-102-01,173 Palestinian teacher , R. Eleazar ( 3rd Cent. ) :
d07-102-02,171 ' The Holy Spirit manifested itself in three places :
d07-102-03,172 the court of Shem , the court of Samuel of Ramah ,
d07-102-04,174 and the court of Solomon . ' The place of this
d07-102-06,171 on the saying of R. Joshua b. Levi which
d07-102-07,172 deals with a similar theme .
m02-066-00,176 All Aristotle was excited at the time , not by the prospect of the
m02-066-01,176 U.S. President's visit , but by a great storm in the photo-
m02-066-02,176 sphere of the sun . A matter which on Earth would hardly
m02-066-03,176 penetrate beyond the minds of astronomers was of general
m02-059-01,176 never her husband , a fact he accepted as inevitable . " I guess
m02-059-02,176 Sally made a mistake about me , " he said one
m02-059-03,176 evening , when he had been left to cook his own meal .
m02-059-05,176 was a Static Mib , the middle-income-bracket equivalent
m02-059-06,176 to 4sub-lil on the lower .
d01-098-00,182 The edge of this sheet was attached to a wooden dowel
d01-098-02,180 a simple and serviceable book . It was robust - the number
d01-098-03,180 which have survived the centuries is ample evidence of
d01-098-04,178 this - and it was easily stored . It had two disadvantages . It
d01-098-05,178 was generally a single-sided form of book , and it was not
d01-104-00,180 This last objection might have had some weight in
d01-104-01,180 ecclesiastical circles . In his Natural History , 13 . 11-12 ,
d01-104-02,179 the elder Pliny tells of the use of papyrus in roll-making .
d01-104-03,179 As Pliny was killed in the eruption of Vesuvius which
d01-104-04,177 overwhelmed Herculaneum and Pompeii in A.D. 79 , his
d01-104-05,177 information is contemporaneous with the New Testament .
d01-104-06,177 The other form of book was the codex . In this the
d01-104-07,180 sheets were bound together down one edge much as
g01-025-00,148 In this cruel process which was
g01-025-01,147 hammering out nations on the anvils of
g01-025-02,147 war , there was a constant stirring of
g01-025-03,147 those in authority to find some simple
g01-025-04,143 way out of the complicated financial
g01-025-05,145 6impasse which always resulted , and in the
g01-025-06,147 story of the experiments and expedients
g01-025-07,147 to which the Exchequer resorted is
g01-025-08,143 the story of the prelude to the
g01-025-09,145 Peasants' Revolt of 1381 .
g01-027-00,151 In appreciating this story , modern con-
g01-027-01,152 ceptions of governmental duties must be
g01-027-02,151 set aside . A modern government needs
g01-027-03,147 taxation not merely for defence and
g01-027-04,147 offence but for a very wide range of
g01-027-05,151 social services . A mediaeval oligarchy
g01-027-06,151 needed taxation in order to supplement
g01-027-07,145 the private wealth of the monarchy
g01-027-09,152 crown lands , the fees of feudalism
f04-039-00,183 This man agreed that his engagement had
f04-039-02,181 tiff , but denied that he owed Miss Camp any
f04-039-03,180 money . All the while the police were casting about
f04-039-04,179 for a man who had been seen leaving the train
f04-039-05,179 at Wandsworth . A passenger described this individual
f04-039-07,178 a dark moustache , and wearing a frockcoat
f04-039-08,178 and a top-hat .
f04-043-00,179 The porter at the station bore out this
f04-043-02,179 Perhaps the news of their search got around ,
f04-043-03,177 for a man did obligingly present himself
f04-043-05,177 committed the murder - but he was mentally
f04-043-07,177 had been nowhere near the 7.42 that evening .

m03-006-03,182 didn't seem to want to get off the raft . '
m03-006-04,182 He peered as it were into the dark secrets
m03-006-07,182 night , exceptionally brilliant and strange ,
m03-006-08,182 for in the proximity of the mountains ,
m03-006-09,182 whose presence I could almost smell ,
d04-050-00,170 They will not work in union . If physical power , spiritual power
d04-050-01,170 and visionary power is not united , man will remain in his heart
d04-050-02,172 selfish and think only of one's personal advantage to
d04-050-03,170 gratify selfish aims , then each man will gather-in
d04-050-04,172 for himself only , instead of all to help to gather your
d06-037-00,182 To others , the long hours of the night bring
d06-037-01,181 only a disturbed tossing and turning
d06-037-02,180 which causes them to wake feeling worse
d06-037-03,179 than when they went to bed . We may begin
d06-037-04,178 to understand this a little better when we
d06-037-05,180 realize that tiredness itself is largely in
d06-037-06,177 the mind . Very few people , under normal
d06-037-07,177 conditions , work themselves to a standstill .
d06-072-01,178 their place of work and their associates at
d06-072-03,179 are possibly like in the surroundings of their
d06-072-04,179 homes . It is easy , desperately easy , to lead
d06-072-05,178 a ' double ' life without ever deliberately
d06-072-06,180 planning to do so or in fact being conscious
d06-072-07,178 of what is going on . It is easier to live life in
d06-072-08,174 compartments but over the years it builds up ,
d06-072-09,176 and to do so inevitably builds up tensions which
d06-100-00,178 As it is , with so much of our life already
d06-100-01,178 in a predetermined groove , I would
d06-100-02,180 hardly like to add further to the dullness
d06-100-04,179 for this . I know how much of a drag it can be
d06-100-05,177 and I was interested some little while
d06-100-06,178 ago to hear of a school who tried a six-
d06-100-07,178 day timetable .
e06-033-00,177 Herring fishermen call this " the outset " . It
e06-033-01,178 is strongest at spring tides , when without
e06-033-02,179 wind you will " set " out - or drift to the east-
e06-033-03,179 ward , the length of half a fleet of nets -
e06-033-04,177 almost a mile on every tide at the Smith's
e06-033-05,178 Knoll . Without an explanation of how it
e06-033-07,179 to the mouth of a great salmon river , has
e06-033-08,174 been the biggest factor through the ages
e06-033-09,175 in the constancy of this great herring fishery .
e06-070-00,180 Actually the seine net has little or no cover .
e06-070-01,182 And in this film the rise of the fish was
e06-070-02,180 small , a matter of a foot or two . With round
e06-070-03,180 fish like haddock , which would hardly
e06-070-05,179 would seem to be even more essential ;
e06-070-06,178 but more films are needed to prove this .
e06-070-08,177 essential to catch round fish whose
e06-070-09,178 reaction to disturbance would be upwards .
n03-113-01,181 weren't worried . We 're going to

f07-088a-00,174 A fascinating study also opens up in
f07-088a-01,171 the dietary welcomed by men of genius
f07-088a-02,170 as well as the foods for which they have
f07-088a-03,172 had an aversion . Shelley , for example ,
f07-088a-04,174 had a great contempt for animal
f07-088a-05,172 food , believing that it impaired the
f07-088a-07,172 fast and supper consisted of a
f07-088a-08,173 piece of coarse bread and a
f07-088a-09,170 bowl of milk .
f07-092a-00,174 Dante Gabriel Rossetti had simple tastes
f07-092a-01,172 in food . At one dinner he is said to have
f07-092a-02,169 been blind to the charms of turbot and
f07-092a-03,169 to have been much more interested
f07-092a-04,169 in the dish in which it was served . He
f07-092a-05,168 turned it over on the table cloth to
f07-092a-06,167 examine the marks on the back
f07-092a-07,168 without going through the formality
f07-092a-08,168 of having his turbot removed first .
n03-064-00,177 Around that rounded rocky promontory where the
n03-064-03,179 triangular sail , and to the judge's frightened eyes , so
n03-064-04,176 close to the rocks that it would be dashed
d06-003-00,155 Even worse is to laugh . Tremendous damage may be done to a child
d06-003-01,156 by laughing at what are very real fears . As adults , we know
d06-003-02,155 that their fears are groundless , indeed to us they appear laughable ,
d06-003-03,155 but to a child they are very real . Not that I am suggesting
d06-003-04,155 that children should be molly-coddled - they must be made
d06-003-05,156 to face their fears , to see through them and come out on the
d06-003-06,155 other side as victors .
d06-076-00,156 Can we then frame some ' rules ' which may enable us to live life
d06-076-01,155 as fully as possible , without having our energy sapped by un-
d06-076-03,156 We have a saying ' My head will never save my feet ' . Time
d06-076-04,156 after time we forget something and have to go back
d06-076-05,153 upstairs or down to the shops .
d06-111-00,155 I would not want to either , but if she wants to get through
d06-111-02,155 sit down quietly and make a list of everything she has got to
d06-111-03,155 do , note the order in which they can most conveniently be
d06-111-04,154 done ( or must be done because of other predetermined factors
d06-111-05,154 - you must , for example , do your shopping on the morning of
e06-010-00,155 In this 200-fathom trench the herring do not touch the bottom .
e06-010-01,155 Their descent stops at the end of the light pressure . But
e06-010-02,155 they migrate easterly to the Norwegian side , or westerly , until
e06-010-03,154 in the shallower water the mile wide layers disappear from the
e06-010-04,155 echo-sounders . Bottom crowding comes when they cannot reach
e06-010-05,154 their optimum depth ; and this coincides with the suitable
e06-010-06,156 gravelly soil of these many roughs where the spring-
e06-010-07,155 spawning herring are always found .
e06-046-02,156 sand ; or even in the case of flat fish , by vibrations
e06-046-03,157 through or along the bottom . ) But given such a bow
e06-046-04,157 wave of disturbance , it is obvious that without something
n03-038-00,175 He had almost entirely settled back into his old
n03-038-01,172 ways , even to reading law about two hours each
n03-038-02,176 day . Though he did not refuse wine , which the
n03-038-04,175 did not act as though he found it necessary
n03-038-05,176 except in moderate compliance with his father's
n03-038-06,172 habit .
d06-011-00,181 Because situations which may contain
d06-011-01,182 all the elements of fear can arise suddenly ,
d06-011-02,180 it is a good idea to condition a child
d06-011-03,179 to some extent against it . To keep a child
d06-011-04,178 of twelve or thirteen under the
d06-011-05,180 impression that nothing nasty ever
d06-011-06,179 happens is not merely dishonest , it
d06-011-07,178 is unwise . As I shall suggest in a
d06-011-08,176 later chapter there are some situations
d06-011-09,176 which occur less frequently than
d06-107-00,177 It was a little complicated to work ,
d06-107-02,177 notice in the entrance saying which
d06-107-03,178 day of the timetable it was - but
d06-107-05,179 and kept everybody on their toes .
d06-107-06,179 To have order does not mean getting
d06-107-07,179 into a dull routine . I have great
d06-107-08,177 sympathy with the young wife
d06-107-09,177 who does not always want to do
e06-003-00,180 Thus we can see that herring
e06-003-01,179 movements , although primarily
e06-003-04,178 are also closely related to the sea-bed
e06-003-05,177 geography . Geography , too , names the
e06-003-06,176 great fisheries that depend on them :
e06-003-10,179 the herring spawn along the northern
e06-015-01,178 and fishing gear leads to an overall
e06-015-02,178 though somewhat dim picture .
e06-015-03,176 The details are harder still to see .
e06-015-05,177 shoals that gather at the Knoll or
e06-015-06,175 other banks are most of them
e06-015-07,175 going to travel a hundred
e06-015-08,174 miles farther south before they
e06-015-09,176 spawn . Some will spawn at the
e06-030-00,180 Easterly winds , on the other hand ,
e06-030-02,178 recent years have shown . A succession
e06-030-03,178 of winds is needed for this effect of
e06-030-04,178 course - one breeze will not do it ,
e06-030-07,178 but quite apart from this wind effect
e06-030-08,177 there is an easterly drift special
e06-030-09,177 to this rump of coastline , caused by
f04-061-00,171 Some thought that the result would be all
f04-061-01,170 sorts of horrible illnesses brought on by the
f04-061-02,168 confined atmosphere . " The shareholders who travel
f04-061-03,169 by it will be so heartily sick , what with the
f04-061-04,171 foul air , smoke and sulphur , that the mention
f04-061-06,167 wrote an anti-railway industrialist when it was
f04-061-07,169 proposed to build the Box Tunnel .
f04-064-00,169 The mere thought of subterranean travel
f04-064-01,172 gave others a feeling of danger . A medical journal
f04-064-02,170 said , " the deafening peal of thunder , the sudden
f04-064-03,169 immersion in gloom , and the clash of reverberated
f04-064-04,172 sounds in a confined space combine to produce a
f04-064-05,169 momentary shudder , or idea of destruction , a thrill
f04-064-07,170 passengers would be robbed and assaulted in the
f04-064-08,169 darkness .

m01-125-00,170 So they proceeded to see if the coast
m01-125-01,170 was clear . The street was quiet and

m01-125-04,169 ventured forth and made their way on

m01-125-06,166 to the door at their ring but neglected
m01-125-07,170 to offer any greeting . He was deeply
m01-125-08,171 preoccupied , and it seemed that the

p02-008-06,182 Gavin and the girl who had got
p02-008-07,182 off the plane with him were talking .
p02-008-08,182 He was writing something in his

p02-008-10,182 of despair Gay knew that of course
n02-028-05,179 had had a thoroughly good time , and it would take them
n02-028-06,177 nearly to next week to settle down again . Meanwhile

m06-031-00,159 ' But we - ' ' Stop your stupid talk , woman ! ' ' We are - '
m06-031-01,158 ' Be silent , woman , and listen , ' Band Appa Bondi said .
m06-031-03,158 things we will tell you . All who make the journey from
m06-031-04,158 the Heavy World become changed . Some die . Most live
m06-031-05,157 and grow wings . Between the worlds are many strong
m06-042-00,161 When you come here , when you come to the True
m06-042-02,160 tigerfly is not a tigerfly until it changes . So humans
m06-042-03,160 change . ' ' I cannot know what he says , ' Haris said
m06-042-04,159 stubbornly , throwing himself down . But Lily-yo and
m06-042-05,161 Flor were listening .
m06-048-03,160 it dies when it changes into a tigerfly . ' ' You are still
m06-048-04,160 young , ' said the Chief Captive . ' You begin newly here .
m06-048-06,159 each other . In their flight from the 4wiltmilt they had
m06-048-07,159 heedlessly thrown down their souls .
m06-056-00,156 Haris had trampled on his . It was unthinkable !
m06-056-01,157 ' You see . You needed them no more . You are still
m06-056-02,157 young . You may be able to have babies . Some of those
m06-056-03,158 babies may be born with wings . ' The Captive with
m06-056-04,158 the boneless arms added , ' Some may be born wrong ,
m06-056-05,156 as we are . Some may be born right . '
m06-067-00,159 ' You are too foul to live ! ' Haris growled . ' Why are
m06-067-01,159 you not killed ? ' ' Because we know all things , ' the
m06-067-02,159 Chief Captive said . Suddenly his second head roused
m06-067-03,159 itself and declared , ' To be a good shape is not all
m06-067-04,158 in life . To know is also good . Because we cannot move
m06-067-05,156 well we can - think . This tribe of the True World
m06-076-00,159 So it lets us rule it . ' Flor and Lily-yo
m06-076-01,159 muttered together . ' Do you say that you poor
m06-076-03,160 at last . ' We do . ' ' Then why are you captives ? '
m06-076-04,158 The flyman with ear lobes and thumbs connected ,
m06-076-05,157 making his perpetual little gesture of protest ,
m06-076-06,158 spoke for the first time .
m06-083-00,160 ' To rule is to serve , woman . Those who bear power
m06-083-01,160 are slaves to it . Only an outcast is free . Because
m06-083-02,159 we are Captives , we have the time to talk and
m06-083-03,159 think and plan and know . Those who know
m06-083-04,158 command the knives of others . ' ' No hurt will
m06-083-05,157 come to you , Lily-yo , ' Band Appa Bondi added .
m06-083-06,158 ' You will live among us and enjoy your life free
m06-083-07,157 from harm . '
m06-091-00,158 ' No ! ' the Chief Captive said with both mouths .
m06-091-01,159 ' Before she can enjoy , Lily-yo and her companion
m06-091-02,159 Flor - this other man creature is plainly useless -
m06-091-03,158 must help our great plan . ' ' The invasion ? ' Bondi
m06-091-06,158 and its savage life are still fresh in you .
m06-098-00,158 We need such memories . So we ask you to go
m06-098-01,159 back there on a great plan we have . ' ' Go back ? '
m06-098-02,158 gasped Flor . ' Yes . We plan to attack the Heavy
m06-098-03,158 World . You must help to lead our force . ' The long
m06-098-04,158 afternoon of eternity wore on , that long golden road
m06-098-05,156 of an afternoon that would somewhere lead to
m06-098-06,156 everlasting night .
m06-106-00,159 Motion there was , but motion without event - except
m06-106-01,159 for those negligible events that seemed so large to
m06-106-02,159 the creatures participating in them . For Lily-yo , Flor
m06-106-03,159 and Haris there were many events . Chief of these was
m06-106-04,158 that they learned to fly properly . The pains associated
m06-106-05,158 with their wings soon died away as the wonderful
m06-106-06,158 new flesh and tendon strengthened . To sail up in the
m06-106-07,159 light gravity became an increasing delight - the ugly
m06-106-08,158 flopping movements of flymen on the Heavy World
m06-106-09,158 had no place here .
g01-039-00,148 None of these classes , except the yeomen , paid or
g01-039-01,152 expected to pay direct taxes . During the four-
g01-039-02,149 teenth century , the traditional methods of
g01-039-03,145 financing the Exchequer had become stabilized .
g01-039-04,147 When the King and his Council required additio-
g01-039-05,148 nal funds , they were usually granted an
g01-039-06,148 export tax on the wool trade , collected by
g01-039-07,143 means of that ' staple ' system which ensured that
g01-039-08,143 prices , quality and tax could be efficiently su-
g01-039-09,146 pervised and controlled , together with a
g01-043-00,147 There were two other sources of public revenue -
g01-043-01,147 first , the Church , which wisely followed the lead
g01-043-02,147 of the Commons and in its own Convocations
g01-043-04,140 the foreign merchants , with whom the King's
g01-043-05,147 officials had formerly made private bargains
g01-043-07,141 payments were now authorized by parliamentary
g01-043-08,142 sanction at a rate roughly fifty per cent in
g01-043-09,143 excess of the rate for native merchants .
g01-045-00,148 In addition to these revenues , the King had the
g01-045-01,146 financial benefits of his position at the head
g01-045-02,147 of the feudal system , as its chief landowner
g01-045-03,141 and the recipient of the fines of royal justice .
g01-045-04,139 It was , therefore , a complicated and not very
g01-045-05,146 satisfactory financial system in which the
g01-045-06,144 borders between private and public purse were
g01-045-08,141 and national war , and in which the comparati-
g01-045-09,146 vely simple obligations of the feudal pyramid
m04-231-00,168 " Do as I say , driver . " Very stern , the reverend
m04-231-01,164 gentleman was . So the driver peep-peeped as
m04-231-02,164 through empty space . " Thank you , " the Rev.
m04-231-03,164 Edwards said courteously . " Secondly , we must
m04-231-04,161 pool and ration our supplies of food , if any . "
m04-231-06,161 a great basket .
m04-238-00,176 " Now , who has any food ? " he asked hopefully .
m04-238-02,176 " Mr. Price , I think you may be able to help us here , "
m04-238-03,176 said the Rev. Edwards . Price shook his head .
m04-238-04,172 " Intended for Plas Newydd , this lot is . Paid for ,
m04-238-05,172 too . " He folded his arms protectively over the basket .
m04-246-00,176 Mutinous dog , thought the Rev. Edwards , who hadn't
m04-246-01,176 enjoyed himself so much since reading Treasure
m04-246-02,176 Island . " What have you got in that basket , Price ? "
m04-246-03,176 he roared . Quelled , Mr. Price pulled out a grocery
m04-246-04,176 list , pushed his glasses up on his nose , and
m04-246-05,172 began to read . " Six loaves , four pounds butter ,
m04-246-06,172 two pounds marge , one tin pineapple , one York ham . "
n04-000-00,176 Bertram's face was grim . " You think it was the Snort ,
n04-000-01,176 don't you ? " John gave a short laugh . " I did , " he
n04-000-02,176 said ; " but I 'd better stop thinking that now .
n04-000-03,176 Pericles is fitted with an identically similar one . "
n04-000-04,176 " So there you are , my dear . " Peggy 's eyes filled
n04-000-05,176 with tears . " It 's so unfair , " she said .
n04-009-00,176 " That little beast Robbie Munyard spent six
n04-009-01,176 months ashore while Pericles was refitting in the
n04-009-02,176 dockyard and now that she 's ready for sea he goes
n04-009-03,179 sick . Just because he 's an Honourable he can do
n04-009-04,179 what he likes . Anyway , why pick on you to succeed
m02-112-00,161 So once again the metaphysics were depressing ,
m02-112-01,161 and in absolute contrast to the physical display .
m02-112-02,161 Mos have an un-American love of parades , and
m02-112-03,161 these young ones , on parade for jobs which they
m02-112-05,161 putting their best foot forward .
p02-150-06,191 understand , knowing that Gay was as much ashamed
p02-150-07,203 for Gavin at the way he was behaving as she
p02-150-08,203 was hurt for herself .
m01-110-00,157 There can be little doubt that if the
m01-110-01,156 Thetans discover our mental independence
m01-110-02,157 they will promptly give us their hypnotic
m01-110-03,159 treatment . If we can avoid undue
m01-110-04,159 prominence , it may be that we can
m01-110-05,155 move about pretty freely without
m01-110-06,157 detection . If we can - well , then we
m01-110-08,156 interests . What those interests

m01-131-00,161 When he finally beckoned to them to enter , the action
m01-131-01,161 gave the impression of having been thought out and
m01-131-05,163 their heads like tennis spectators as he walked up and
m01-131-06,159 down , up and down .
p03-023-00,191 She was engaged to Nigel , had been for two years .
p03-023-01,182 Sometimes they talked on the theme of " when we get married " ,
p03-023-02,191 and then all was wonderful , and perhaps it had only been
p03-023-03,191 a slip of the tongue when Nigel had said , only last
p03-023-05,182 that lark , I can tell you ! "
g02-062-00,160 At one and the same time , therefore , occur the beat
g02-062-01,160 of the apex , the thickening of the heart walls , and
g02-062-02,160 the forcible expulsion of their contained blood by the
g02-062-03,152 contraction of the ventricles . Going on in Chapter Three
g02-062-04,152 to the movement of the arteries , likewise gauged from
g02-062-05,152 the dissections of living animals , Harvey noted that
g02-062-06,152 contraction of the heart and the apex beat occur in
g02-062-07,152 systole , simultaneously with dilatation of the arteries
g02-062-08,152 and of the artery-like vein , and expulsion of the
g02-062-09,152 ventricular content .
n01-057-00,179 Geoffrey set himself to consider the
n01-057-01,179 movements of the Bentley . It had passed
n01-057-02,179 him at the temporary bridge over the
n01-057-03,178 Tartaro at a few minutes past ten on the
n01-057-04,178 previous night . He worked out the distance
n01-057-05,175 on the presumption that its route had been
n01-057-06,176 through Florence and Rome and then
n01-057-07,178 across Italy via Foggia to Barletta .
n01-057-08,175 It came to just over six hundred
n01-057-09,175 miles .
c06-011-00,149 ALSO present is a London journalist who
c06-011-01,148 arrived two hours earlier by appointment
c06-011-02,149 to talk to the author of Borstal Boy and
c06-011-03,150 The Hostage about his new work , if any ,
c06-011-04,148 and who is now being pluckily convivial
c06-011-05,148 to fight off the frustration . The telephone
c06-011-06,149 has rung a couple of times , calls from
c06-011-07,150 other chums sniffing the wind and
c06-011-08,148 offering to drop by for a chat .
d06-008-00,148 To ridicule them only pushes them farther
d06-008-01,149 into themselves , so that they become
d06-008-02,147 unable to speak about it to anybody and
d06-008-03,149 the seeds of any amount of trouble are sown ,
d06-008-04,148 the harvest of which may still be being
d06-008-05,147 reaped at forty or fifty . Far better to
d06-008-06,149 agree with a child that a particular
d06-008-07,148 situation is frightening , and then to face
d06-008-08,147 it together until the child can see how
d06-008-09,148 unnecessary its fears were .
d06-020-00,148 In Gethsemane He prayed that the cup
d06-020-01,149 should pass from Him . Jesus shows us
d06-020-02,150 the way to face life . To see all the latent
d06-020-03,149 frightening possibilities and yet by facing
d06-020-04,149 them and knowing God is with us and
d06-020-05,150 that , with Him , there is nothing that can
d06-020-06,148 finally defeat us . More than that , that God
d06-020-07,149 has something important to do with our
d06-020-08,148 lives and that the nearer we get to Him ,
d06-020-09,148 the stronger we become .
d06-046-00,146 Even more simply , test your own reactions
d06-046-01,146 to different situations . There are some which
d06-046-02,146 bring on an almost immediate feeling of
d06-046-03,147 tiredness - such as when your wife mentions
d06-046-05,145 refer to something you like doing , bring a
d06-046-06,147 veritable surge of energy . Many a girl who
d06-046-08,145 up with no apparent tiredness at all when
d06-046-09,148 her boy friend calls and go for a long walk .
d06-063-00,145 In the days when most people were born ,
d06-063-01,145 lived and died within the boundaries of
d06-063-02,146 the village , it was not difficult for anybody
d06-063-03,146 to live a day at a time . Even those who
d06-063-04,146 held a high and responsible office lived in
d06-063-05,146 far greater simplicity than their successors .
d06-063-06,147 When news from the Continent took days ,
d06-063-07,145 from America weeks , from the Far East ,
d06-063-08,146 months , even a Prime Minister could go to
d06-063-09,146 sleep in blissful ignorance of what might
g01-088-00,148 Trebling the rate was arrived at by a simple
g01-088-04,147 The only concession made in view of the
g01-088-05,147 objections to the first two poll-taxes was
g01-088-06,145 the suggestion that the rich should help
g01-088-07,143 the poor - but this was only a pious hope
g01-088-08,145 because no machinery was provided for
g01-088-09,148 carrying it into effect , and a subordinate
g03-032-00,188 Soon they were good enough to sing at meetings .
g03-032-01,189 One of the helpful by-products was that
g03-032-02,190 they were able to obtain some respectable
g03-032-04,190 and Red Flag badge , thus presenting a much
g03-032-05,187 better appearance . Later , on many a sunny Sunday
g03-032-06,189 evening , when George went to speak at Malin Bridge ,
g03-032-07,190 they would be there to begin the meeting .
m02-087-00,176 But privately he turned out to be as friendly as
m02-087-01,161 Mr. Wise the tube manufacturer , to have the same adolescent
m02-087-02,176 openness and freshness , though perhaps not the same
m02-087-03,176 maturity . One remembered that he was a lawyer
m02-087-04,161 by training , and suspected that the points he made
m02-087-05,161 so sharply in international politics were as abstract
m02-087-06,161 to him as those a lawyer makes in a court
m02-087-07,161 of law .
f07-088b-00,174 A fascinating study also opens up in the dietary
f07-088b-01,174 welcomed by men of genius as well as the foods for
f07-088b-02,174 which they have had an aversion . Shelley , for example ,
f07-088b-03,172 had a great contempt for animal food , believing that
f07-088b-04,166 it # impaired the intellectual faculties . Bunyan's
f07-088b-05,162 breakfast and supper consisted of a piece of coarse bread
f07-088b-06,168 and a bowl of milk .
f07-092b-00,173 Dante Gabriel Rossetti had simple tastes in food . At one
f07-092b-01,175 dinner he is said to have been blind to the charms of
f07-092b-02,173 turbot and to have been much more interested in the
f07-092b-04,171 on the table cloth to examine the marks on the back
f07-092b-05,168 without going through the formality of having his turbot
f07-092b-06,167 removed first .
f07-096-00,175 Wagner was a highly practical feeder . He ate very fast ,
f07-096-01,176 placing his food in his mouth and gulping it down as
f07-096-02,174 he talked . Brigham Young would make a dinner on tripe
f07-096-03,174 which he washed down with beer . A writer who had dinner
f07-096-04,171 with Dickens says the menu was Whitstable oysters , a brown
f07-096-05,167 sole , a baked leg of mutton with oyster & veal stuffing and a
f07-096-06,169 gin punch .
f07-101b-00,175 The same man went to see Carlyle , and , after mentioning
f07-101b-01,173 that he had dined with Longfellow told the sage a
f07-101b-02,174 very funny story which made Carlyle absolutely laugh ;
f07-101b-03,177 but all the Chelsea philosopher did in return was to
f07-101b-04,172 ask if his guest would have a cup of tea !
g07-000b-01,176 to Douglas Kinnaird saying that it was incorrect
g07-000b-02,175 throughout . He had no sooner heard from Count Gamba
g07-000b-03,175 and Fletcher that Byron would have wished his
g07-000b-04,168 body to return to England than that course was
g07-000b-05,167 ' immediately carried into effect ' - not in spite of himself
g07-000b-06,170 and Sir Frederick Stoven , but with their perfect con-
g07-000b-07,172 currence , while ' General Adam was at Corfu the whole
g07-000b-08,166 time and # never interfered in the slightest
g07-000b-09,169 degree about the matter ' .
p02-000-00,182 There were few passengers on the plane and Gavin was
p02-000-01,182 quickly through the customs . " Gay ! " " Gavin ! " The girl
p02-000-02,182 and her luggage had disappeared and they were alone
p02-000-03,182 together . The porter brought Gavin's bag out to the
p02-000-05,182 hand and smiled . " I want to check up on the
p02-000-06,182 flights back . "
m01-049-00,186 He rose from his breakfast-nook bench
m01-049-01,187 and came into the livingroom , where
m01-049-02,188 Heather and Steve stood aghast at
m01-049-03,188 his entrance . He came , almost falling
m01-049-04,185 forward in an ungainly shuffle , neck
m01-049-05,185 thrust out , arms dangling loosely .
m01-049-06,185 Then , abruptly , he drew himself up
m01-049-07,187 and walked on the very tips of
m01-049-08,184 his toes . He stretched his arms
m01-049-10,187 drawing-in great breaths that
p03-027-02,203 word shouted into her very soul a horn of warning , and
p03-027-03,203 with it was coupled a disembodied fragment of information ,
p03-027-05,203 seen in Farlingham on an occasion he had sworn he had
p03-027-06,203 been standing in for Luke Parsons at his surgery in
p03-027-07,203 Little Phelpham .
g01-067-00,151 But this time there was a very interesting
g01-067-01,154 attempt to apply a sliding scale to the
g01-067-02,153 payments demanded . The definition of an
g01-067-03,152 adult was altered to read ' over sixteen ' ,
g01-067-04,147 and , where the poorest were to pay a groat ,
g01-067-05,151 the Duke of Lancaster and the Archbishops
g01-067-06,152 of Canterbury and York were to pay ten marks ,
g01-067-07,152 and between these two extremes a graduated
g01-067-08,145 scale of payments was fixed for the
g01-067-09,151 different classes of laymen and clerics .
g01-070-00,152 Again the resentment was widespread and
g01-070-01,153 the results disappointing - a tax estimated
g01-070-02,156 to yield 50,000 in fact raised only 27,000 .
g01-070-03,150 In the following year , 1380 , the last and
g01-070-04,148 most notorious third poll-tax was agreed
g01-070-05,149 by a Parliament which met at Northampton .
g01-070-06,154 There were dark reasons for a meeting so
g01-070-07,152 far away from the capital in a town with
g01-070-08,149 poor communications and not over supplied
g01-070-09,151 with hostelries and lodgings .
g01-074-00,143 London was again in turmoil ; but this time
g01-074-01,144 over a question of trade rivalry . A rich mer-
g01-074-02,146 chant from Genoa had been murdered , and
g01-074-03,140 John de Kyrkby , a Londoner , was one of
g01-074-04,139 those charged with the crime . It is clear
g01-074-05,143 from the chronicles that this was a sordid
g01-074-06,143 quarrel between monopolists and interlopers .
g01-074-07,143 The city merchants were jealous of foreign
g01-074-08,141 merchants who could tempt court and
g01-074-09,144 baronage with rarer luxuries than those
f04-083-01,163 long brown hair in a bun at the back of her head
f04-083-02,164 remained a mystery until later the following day .
f04-083-03,164 During that time a description of the girl was
f04-083-04,163 circulated , and a Mr Robert Money came forward to
f04-083-05,161 identify her as his sister , Mary Money , aged twenty-two .
f04-087-00,165 On the Sunday , the day of her death , she had gone out in the
f04-087-01,164 evening at about seven o'clock , telling her room-mate , Emma
f04-087-02,164 Hone , that she was going for a walk , but would not be
f04-087-03,163 gone for long . According to Miss Hone , she had not been
f04-087-04,161 carrying a handbag , but she believed she had had a small
f04-087-05,159 purse .
p03-033-01,191 he shrugged diffidently , " I like the work . One gets plenty
p03-033-02,191 of variety and it 's a change . " Nigel was the hospital's
p03-033-03,191 Junior Medical Officer . " You won't be free about nine , I
p03-033-04,191 suppose , to meet me for supper somewhere ? " she had
p03-033-05,182 asked hopefully .
p01-147-00,179 Mr. Copthorne knew a way round by the side
p01-147-01,177 of the church where there was a small open
p01-147-02,175 outbuilding where the grave digger kept his spades
p01-147-03,180 and forks and tidying up implements . It might
p01-147-04,175 be open . It was . He entered , and seated himself
p01-147-05,175 in a huddle upon an upturned wheelbarrow .
p01-147-06,172 His curious headgear fell off . Strange things
p01-147-07,171 were going on in his bewildered brain . When
p01-147-08,168 a man was drowning and towards his last
p01-147-09,168 gasp it was scientifically supposed his whole
p01-147-10,169 life came up before him in some cinematic
g02-065-00,182 Arterial pulsation disappears with cessation of
g02-065-01,182 ventricular contraction . During cutting or puncture of
g02-065-02,182 the ventricles , there is often forcible expulsion
g02-065-03,182 of blood from the wound . Arterial diastole is
g02-065-04,182 thus synchronous with cardiac systole but ,
g02-065-05,182 when movement of blood through arteries is
g02-065-06,182 hindered by compression , infarction or inter-
g02-065-07,182 ception , the more distal arteries pulsate
g02-065-09,182 than the impulse of the blood entering them .
p03-012-00,182 " There are all sorts of wonder-
p03-012-01,182 ful jobs in London and I could
p03-012-03,180 one has to know something about fishing
p03-012-04,179 and in Liverpool they 'd want sea-farers .
p03-012-05,179 I don't think I 'd go to Edinburgh un-
p03-012-06,182 less I was a Scot and wanting to get
p03-012-07,182 home , or perhaps a student studying to
p03-012-08,179 be a doctor , and I already know
p03-012-09,176 all about that . "
p03-080-01,191 Though Diana knew the name of every
p03-080-02,191 member of the staff , distinguished or not ,
p03-080-03,191 Nigel often had to think hard to sort
p03-080-05,191 he now demanded . " What was he
d06-025-02,173 Was this : That a secret plan Is hid in
d06-025-04,174 Because of the plan That God , Who
d06-025-05,174 dwells in my hand , Knows this
d06-025-06,175 secret plan , Of the things He will
d06-025-07,174 do for the world Using my hand .
d06-067-01,174 individual has become so complex
d06-067-02,174 that it taxes the mind . Two hundred
d06-067-05,173 piece . Now a man may live twenty ,
d06-067-06,174 thirty even sixty miles from his
d06-067-07,174 work . The only connexion is the
d06-067-08,173 pipeline of the railway on which they
d06-067-09,171 travel day by day .
d06-104-00,175 They only worked , of course , a five-
d06-104-01,173 day week so that in the first week
d06-104-02,175 Monday to Friday were days one
d06-104-03,174 to five of the timetable , the following
d06-104-04,174 Monday was day six and Tuesday
d06-104-05,173 started day one again and so on .
d06-104-06,173 By this means they avoided each
d06-104-07,174 week being the same with a pupil
d06-104-08,171 knowing exactly what the subject
d06-104-09,172 would be on Friday afternoon at
d06-104-10,172 3 p.m. .
e06-026-01,175 explains how these migrating herring
e06-026-02,174 are biased to east or west by the
e06-026-03,174 different winds . Strong westerlies
e06-026-04,174 are well known to bring good
e06-026-05,174 longshore fishings . The surface
e06-026-06,172 water that is blown offshore must
e06-026-07,173 be replaced by an underflow bringing
e06-026-08,172 with it the herring to the Norfolk
e06-026-09,173 and Suffolk beaches .
e06-049-00,174 Let us consider first what would
e06-049-01,175 appear to be the simplest case -
e06-049-02,174 that of flat fish on the bottom .
e06-049-03,174 The evidence suggest that the fish are
e06-049-04,175 aware of the moving footrope before
e06-049-06,173 it , swimming at the same speed
e06-049-07,173 for an unknown period of time , until
p03-173-00,203 Almost in desperation she appealed , " Will you meet
p03-173-01,203 me at the gate , four o'clock tomorrow ? " " Why ? " he
p03-173-04,191 he told her , and suddenly seized her in an embrace
p03-173-05,191 which really hurt . " Without your ring it 's just like
p03-173-07,203 and kissed her again , somewhat startled to
d03-117-00,199 A natural transition from gardens and
d03-117-01,199 orchards to the vital question of water
d03-117-02,196 supply . The pools are probably natural springs
d03-117-03,200 enlarged to become reservoirs or cisterns in
d03-117-05,196 construction in lines 9 , 23-25 of the Moabite Stone ,
d03-117-06,197 which read : And I built Baal-meon and made
d03-117-07,199 in it the reservoir ... and I made both the
d03-117-08,198 reservoirs for water inside the town .
m01-149-00,190 They followed him to a city bus stop on Carling Avenue , where
m01-149-01,189 he waited . The bus stop was a deserted island on an empty street .
m01-149-02,189 But not for long , for soon pedestrians and cars flocked upon
m01-149-03,193 the Avenue from its many tributary streets . It might have
m01-149-04,191 been a normal business-day bustle , except for two anomalies .
m01-149-06,192 walked , or drove , or waited as a person possessed of
m01-149-07,198 a single all-exclusive purpose .
p01-168-00,184 He didn't know what to make of it , but it
p01-168-01,185 was Mr. Copthorne all right . Perhaps he had
p01-168-02,187 been attending some kind of fancy dress do
p01-168-03,186 in London . Very strange his eyes looked . Mad ,
p01-168-04,182 hunted eyes , as if the poor fellow had rocks in
p01-168-05,182 his head , so the verger described afterwards .
p01-168-07,184 speak normally .
g01-012-00,155 When all seemed to be going well , a sortie surprised
g01-012-01,153 moment had charge of the mine ; the mine collapsed
g01-012-02,153 fame and glory . Gaunt was compelled to return
g01-012-03,151 even despised failure . The ' ribald ' Londoners , who
g01-012-04,146 Hawley , were also expressing their disappointment
g01-012-05,150 comparing the failure of a subsidized duke
g01-012-06,152 citizen .
g01-016-00,157 These dreary years of ineffective fighting provide
g01-016-01,159 obvious morals for those who are judges long
g01-016-02,157 after the event . It seems obvious that , though
g01-016-03,154 the longbows of yeomen could pierce the
g01-016-04,151 plate and mail of French knights , a brilliant
g01-016-05,154 battle was no substitute for a sound policy ,
g01-016-06,155 and that , if archers had no target , campaigns
g01-016-07,154 became mere marauding route marches .
g01-019-00,155 It seems obvious that if an expedition to
g01-019-01,154 Brittany was compelled to attack via Calais ,
g01-019-02,155 then the primary essential to the success
g01-019-04,149 command of the Channel . It seems obvious
g01-019-05,154 that divided forces were dissipating the
g01-019-06,154 advantages of a ring of bridge-heads which included
g01-019-07,149 Calais , Cherbourg , Brest , Bordeaux and Bayonne ,
g01-019-08,149 and that there was no hope of final victory
g01-019-09,152 without a large-scale and concentrated invasion .

n02-062-01,187 I 'll give you credit for that . But you didn't press
n02-062-02,188 the matter because , very naturally , you were
n02-062-03,186 thoroughly enjoying Forrest's company in
n02-062-04,186 idyllic surroundings . " " How dare you say
n02-062-05,187 such a thing ? " she blazed . " For goodness'

m04-072-00,173 The two-twenty to Llangrwl has failed to
m04-072-01,170 complete her mission . " Paled , did Dai . For the
m04-072-02,170 two-twenty carried , for him , a cargo more
m04-072-03,169 precious than jewels . Though Mofydd Owen
m04-072-04,167 was , as he feared , departed out of his life ,
m04-072-05,166 he still loved her dearly . Already , even
m04-072-06,168 as with trembling fingers he fastened his
m04-072-07,172 trouser clips , he was seeing her lying in
m04-072-08,170 some dreadful ravine , or beset by
m04-072-09,169 robbers , or being whisked off to Emergency
m04-072-10,168 Ward 10 .
m04-078-00,171 But even his imagination , luckily for him ,
m04-078-01,170 did not visualise the awful truth - that
m04-078-02,171 Morfyyd Owen was already qualifying for
m04-078-05,168 Cadwallader when his child mind grasped
m04-078-06,168 the fact that the green earth was falling
m04-078-07,168 away at a rate of knots .
m04-081-00,170 Where indeed ? Megan Thomas spoke sharply
m04-081-01,170 to the conductor , demanding an explanation .
m04-081-02,170 But nonplussed , the conductor was . A
m04-081-03,169 good man , mind ; knew his job . But out of
m04-081-04,166 depth in this particular instance . Fingered
m04-081-05,167 his ticket-punch nervously . Peered out of
m04-081-06,167 the window . Went and consulted the driver .
m04-081-07,168 " Where are we going ? " he echoed Cadwallader .
m04-081-09,169 " But something very untoward has

m04-093-02,169 folded it , and glanced idly out of the

m04-093-04,174 his head . " God bless my immortal soul , "
m04-093-05,171 he cried . " Never mind your immortal

m04-093-07,168 " Here we are traversing the heavens at the
m04-093-08,168 very moment when we should be

m04-100-01,172 it . " Stung , the conductor was . " What you
m04-100-02,170 expect me to do ? " he inquired , bitter .
m04-100-03,169 " Radio Flying Control at London Airport ,
m04-100-05,171 us nowhere , " boomed the Rev. Edwards .
m04-100-06,170 " It 's all very well , " commented

m02-095-00,176 The political life of Aristotle looked more and more
m02-095-01,176 like a masquerade of business interests in dis-
m02-095-02,176 guise which , far from attracting the allegiance
m02-095-03,176 of free men everywhere , could only repel them .
m02-095-04,176 Then what of the cultural life ? Did this per-
m02-095-05,176 haps nurture a genuinely civilizing impulse
m02-095-06,176 which might in time become social fact
m02-095-07,176 and counteract the obsession with economics
m02-095-08,176 which had grown up during the Moon's

p02-105-01,182 and Simone go through the doorway that led
p02-105-02,182 down to the beach . Gay closed her eyes for a
p02-105-03,182 moment in disgust . She was fully aware that Gavin
p02-105-04,191 would make love to the French girl on the sands ,
p02-105-05,182 and no doubt he would come back soon and
p02-105-06,182 after Simone had left expect her to accept his

p06-042-00,183 And as he spoke , the thought

p06-042-05,179 tied . He dare not precipitate
p06-042-06,180 what might well be another

p06-047-10,178 he tore off the leaflet and
p06-052-01,182 with a deadly finality . Watching
p06-052-02,181 him go , unable to speak , she
p06-052-03,183 felt that part of her was leaving
p06-052-04,181 him . She couldn't hate him ...

p06-052-08,180 thing - not even friendship .
p06-058-00,183 She went back to Philip . But
p06-058-01,183 all she could hear were Nicholas's
p06-058-04,181 Love . She revolted against
p06-058-05,172 the word . Nicholas , Philip ...
p06-058-06,171 where was happiness , or
p06-058-07,170 peace of mind ? Philip put out
p06-058-08,169 a hand and grasped hers .
p06-058-09,169 He needed her . She would find
p06-058-10,168 solace in that fact at least .
p06-069-00,171 She had her truth . How much had built
p06-069-01,169 up from that first ideal , and how
p06-069-05,167 hell lying there , knowing she was

p06-088-02,168 ' Good heavens , darling , why on earth

p06-088-08,166 of suspense . ' It will be interesting
p06-096-04,167 will matter most . ' Strange how just
p06-096-05,167 then Philip was so certain that Nicholas
p06-096-06,167 would never betray him . He loved
p06-096-07,166 Sandra too deeply to ruin her
p06-096-08,168 future happiness . Had ever circum-
p06-104-00,169 He was better ; he had made a
p06-104-01,169 miraculous recovery and Sandra would
p06-104-02,167 soon be his wife . The Devil , he thought ,
p06-104-03,168 certainly looked after his own .

d01-016-00,189 The second said that the problems which arise from the comparisons with
d01-016-01,189 the Synoptics can be reasonably solved by paying due regard to the time and
d01-016-02,189 plan and to the different public for which , or against which , the author wrote .
d01-016-03,189 The third article excluded any allegorical interpretation of the Gospel .
d01-019-00,189 There is a whole group of theories which attempt to explain the problems of the
d01-019-01,189 Fourth Gospel by explanations based on assumed textual dislocations . The
d01-019-02,189 present state of the Gospel is the result of an accident-prone history . The
d01-019-03,189 original was written on a roll , or codex , which fell into disorder or was
d01-019-04,182 accidentally damaged . An editor , who was not the author , made what he
d01-019-05,182 could of the chaos by placing the fragments , or sheets , or pages , in order .

f07-013-00,156 The truth is that good food offers a
f07-013-01,151 programme of entertainment almost
f07-013-02,152 unlimited in its variety and its presen-
f07-013-03,153 tation affords an opportunity of
f07-013-04,152 showing a guest something of ourselves .
f07-013-06,151 meal-times of a simpler world to the
f07-013-07,151 banquets of later days , when the table
f07-013-08,152 groaned under its load of complicated
f07-013-10,150 arts around them the diners were little
f07-016-00,160 There was always the spice of an orgy
f07-016-01,157 in those Roman feasts , for instance , with
f07-016-02,157 all their peacocks and nightingales'
f07-016-05,151 out of Italy into France , we are told ,
f07-016-06,155 by Catherine de Medici . The peasant in
f07-016-07,156 those days , as ever , ate sparingly , but
f07-016-10,157 himself go ; and it was from his simpler
f07-019b-00,159 Epicures and gourmands , sated by the
f07-019b-01,160 unending procession of dishes from those
f07-019b-02,160 mammoth kitchens of the 18th century -
f07-019b-03,162 that amazing epoch of grossness and
f07-019b-04,156 delicacy - sought inspiration at last from
f07-019b-05,152 the dishes of the country , and , instead
f07-019b-06,157 of gorging the eye with magnitude ,
f07-019b-07,161 began to understand the value of
f07-019b-08,158 intelligent selection and comparative
f07-019b-09,158 simplicity , though nowadays their
f07-019b-10,159 simplified meals would seem quite
f07-021b-01,160 of boiling water and food ? The ancient
f07-021b-02,159 Britons , I believe , used to make water hot
f07-021b-03,163 by dropping a red-hot poker into it ,
f07-021b-04,156 because their pots would not stand fire ;
f07-021b-05,149 but Jacob must have had one that
f07-021b-06,156 would , because Esau sold his birthright
f07-021b-07,159 to him for a mess of pottage - and then
f07-024b-01,161 known any way of cooking meat
f07-024b-02,161 except by roasting and boiling . When
f07-024b-03,164 Achilles gave a royal feast the principal
f07-024b-04,159 dish was a grill , which he cooked himself ,
f07-024b-07,158 throws a bed of glowing embers wide ;
f07-024b-08,159 Above the coals the smoking fragment

g04-068-00,184 Meanwhile in Purley there was much activity and much
g04-068-02,187 At a large public meeting we launched the project known as the
g04-068-05,183 wives and relations of the soldiers to get their ' Separation '

g04-072-03,182 task involved a very great deal of detailed work for
g04-072-04,184 the Committee . We had a splendid body of local residents ,
g04-072-06,184 Committee met once a week in the evenings , and
g04-072-07,182 included professional men from every walk of
g04-072-08,181 life .
d04-125-00,167 And we answer , that the Lord our God gave us " four freedoms "
d04-125-01,167 without which Society cannot make progress . And we drink
d04-125-02,170 " four cups " to thank the Lord our God for the " four
d04-125-03,169 freedoms " which are Divine . There are four ways of
d04-125-04,168 redemption : ( 1 ) I will bring you out from under the
d04-131-01,167 people . ( 1 ) I will bring you out from under the
d04-131-02,165 burdens of Egypt : How was it that Israel was
d04-131-03,165 brought out from under the burdens of Egypt ?
d04-131-04,166 Because , they kept the Passover and they were
d04-131-05,164 eating Matzos in Egypt and the " Feast of Matzos "
d04-131-06,164 was known even to Abraham and Lot .
p02-022-00,182 " And then we 'll go for a stroll along the
p02-022-01,182 beach . A moon like this mustn't be wasted . "
p02-022-02,182 He gestured towards the bay where the full
p02-022-03,182 moon was just rising over the rocks , then
p02-022-04,182 laid his hand on hers . Gay smiled at him
p02-022-07,182 only , yet remembering for a second the
p02-022-08,182 kisses she had seen him giving Elaine .
m04-030-00,181 " Good-bye , Dai , " said Morfydd , smiling from the bottom step .
m04-030-02,181 She was already up the bus steps , and the bus was away . And Morfydd Owen
m04-030-03,180 waving , unkissed , from the window . And Dai , on the pavement , knowing in his
m04-030-04,180 heart that Morfydd was leaving him as surely as she was leaving Dinas .
m04-038-00,181 So the bus set out for Llangrwl . But it never reached there ! Somewhere ,
m04-038-01,182 on those fifteen miles of mountain roads , it disappeared from the earthly
m04-038-02,181 scene . The first intimation that all was not well came when a
m04-038-03,181 Mr. Isaiah Roberts , landlord of The Traveller's Joy , rang up the
m04-038-04,180 Dinas Motor Omnibus Co. to ask what had happened to their
m04-038-05,176 damn bus .
m04-043-03,181 reasonably . " Start running punctual and where are you ? People get
m04-061-00,182 " And what are you going to do about it ? " Tendentious , Mr. Roberts sounded .
m04-061-04,182 and scour the countryside between here and The Traveller's Joy .

d04-066-09,170 them without visionary power .
f07-000-00,192 SOME years ago a contemporary philosopher
f07-000-01,193 told us that there was nothing an En-
f07-000-03,191 rican would not say ; nothing an
f07-000-04,190 Italian would not sing ; no music
f07-000-06,188 dance ; nothing the German would
f07-000-08,186 would not eat .
f07-039a-01,190 and flowers proved of sovereign power
f07-039a-02,187 clarifying the functions of the brain . It
f07-039a-03,188 is said that there is nothing new under
f07-039a-04,187 the sun , but regarding foodstuffs the
f07-039a-05,184 traveller occasionally encounters a certain
f07-039a-06,184 measure of novelty .
f07-042a-01,188 a delicacy . The visitor is told that
f07-042a-02,189 they restore the hair of the bald and that
f07-042a-03,190 a stewed black rat will ward off a fever .
f07-042a-04,188 A number of newly-born white mice served
f07-042a-05,187 alive , dipped in treacle and swallowed
f07-042a-06,186 like a prairie oyster is considered a
f07-042a-07,186 piece of resistance .
f07-046a-00,189 Among the natives of Northern Australia lizards
f07-046a-01,189 roasted on the point of a spear are
f07-046a-02,188 definitely a delicacy while Mediterranean
f07-046a-03,188 peoples have a high opinion of the octopus
f07-046a-05,187 and the Chinese . The Celestials , apart
f07-046a-09,183 of it in almost any provision shop .
g07-079a-02,187 her practically all his money caused it to
g07-079a-03,186 crumble to oblivion . Though Lady Byron
g07-079a-04,184 knew perfectly well that Byron , as early
g07-079a-08,181 and it came as an appalling surprise to
g07-079a-09,182 Captain Byron that he had been left
g07-079a-10,180 without the fortune that would keep up the
d01-118-00,156 Against these advantages the codex was fragile and
d01-118-01,157 might be bulky . It is sometimes possible to tell
d01-118-02,156 whether or not a particular text was written on
d01-118-03,157 a roll or a codex . Rolls were prepared for
d01-118-04,154 writing , but any papyrus left unused at the
d01-118-05,154 end could be cut off . If the text was longer than
d01-118-06,157 the roll , a sheet could easily be glued on .
d01-123-00,191 The verso of the roll was blank , and one
d01-123-01,189 cannot think of an author , Mark for example ,
d01-123-02,189 sending out his Gospel lacking the ending ,
d01-123-03,190 while one whole side of his roll was unused .
d01-123-04,161 The codex form was not so accommodating . Even
d01-123-05,156 in the case of the single-sheet quire , an extra
d01-123-06,157 sheet glued on might have to be gummed on
d01-123-07,158 over the binding , or the whole codex rebound .
e01-055-00,156 One can remember with horror the pictures of the
e01-055-01,157 overcrowded and over-embellished drawing-rooms
e01-055-02,157 complete with heavy crochet antimacassars , mantel-
e01-055-03,158 piece covers with a fringing of clumsy bobbles and
e01-055-04,155 numerous other crocheted pieces . It was some years
e01-055-05,154 after the Victorian period that designers realised
e01-055-06,156 the potentialities of the craft , and crochet was
e01-055-07,157 revived with designs suitable for contemporary
e01-055-08,157 trends . Crochet today has a variety of uses , and
e01-055-09,156 has even stepped into the field of high fashion .

f04-074-01,169 He sent word straight away to near-by Merstham
f04-074-02,167 Station , and a stretcher party took the body to
f04-074-03,168 the Feathers Hotel to await identification .
f04-074-04,169 Was it a case of suicide , where some unhappy soul
f04-074-05,164 had walked deliberately into the blackness and
f04-074-06,167 into the path of some train ? This hardly seemed

f04-074-10,167 almost tight enough to strangle her , and the ends
f04-079-00,168 Both her wrists bore the marks of severe bruising ,
f04-079-01,167 and there were other injuries on her body which had
f04-079-02,167 occurred before her death was ensured by some
f04-079-03,168 train which had roared through the tunnel . There were
f04-079-04,169 no letters or papers found on her to assist identi
f04-079-05,167 fication , no money , and no railway ticket . By then
f04-079-06,167 reports were being gathered about all traffic over
f04-079-07,167 this stretch of line , but no information was
f04-079-08,168 forthcoming about any carriage with an open
f04-079-09,167 door , nor any passenger reporting an incident
f04-079-10,169 which might relate .

p03-029-02,182 when she was not free ; this much they had
p03-029-03,191 conceded one to the other . They rarely
p03-029-04,191 found they were off duty together , and
p03-029-05,191 the situation would have been intolerable
p03-029-07,191 about their relationship . So when Nigel
p03-029-08,191 had told her about taking Luke's
p03-029-09,203 evening surgery she had said ,

n03-097-04,192 black eyes showing any emotion . With a
n03-097-05,191 quick shift of tiller , and at the same time
n03-097-06,194 jibbing the boom to which he had the
n03-097-07,195 stay rope fastened , Bill made the
n03-097-08,195 yawl recover .
n03-103-00,186 It seemed to the frightened judge
n03-103-01,186 as though his son would actually
n03-103-02,189 shoot the craft in under the outer
n03-103-03,182 end of the wharf . But by pressing
n03-103-04,179 the tiller hard over and at the
n03-103-05,186 same time dropping the small sheet
n03-103-06,186 of wet canvas , Bill cleared the
n03-103-07,183 corner of the pier by inches , and
n03-103-08,182 with the tiller still hard over , brought

c04-150-00,184 Potter screamed during an action , and was arrested . He
c04-150-01,185 claimed he had seen a vision of God - only the padre and his
c04-150-02,182 C O believed him . Courtenay played the part with a gawky ,
c04-150-03,182 Northern defiance . The cameras played continuously on his
c04-150-04,182 craggy face , and obstinate , baffled eyes . They stripped
c04-150-06,179 what he was - Potter , a frightened boy who had a

n01-004-03,179 she checked back her instructions . It was
n01-004-04,177 obvious that she did not fail to appreciate the
n01-004-05,177 faith which he was placing in her and
n01-004-06,175 was prepared to accept the responsibility .
p02-101-00,176 His behaviour was not only boorish and in the worst of
p02-101-01,176 taste but it was unkind beyond words . She fumbled
p02-101-02,176 with the cigarette packet which lay on the table
p02-101-03,176 not wanting to smoke but needing some action
p02-101-04,176 to help her control her feelings . " Come and

f07-028a-02,176 made rapid progress , because they were men of taste
f07-028a-03,173 and intellect . A remarkable peculiarity in the banquets
f07-028a-04,171 of the ancient world was the fact that they did not
f07-028a-05,170 confine the resources of the table to the gratification
f07-028a-06,172 of one sense alone . Having exhausted their invention
f07-028a-07,169 in the preparation of stimulants for the palate ,
f07-028a-08,171 they broke fresh ground and called another sense

p02-069-00,177 Gay , a little puzzled , went through
p02-069-01,177 to the bar . Doc and Lilyan were
p02-069-02,176 sitting just inside having coffee .
p02-069-03,178 " Come and join us and bring your

p02-069-08,176 tonight so come and join us if you

p02-090-01,178 as Gay drew out a chair and sat
p02-090-02,178 down Gavin , without a word , swept
p02-090-03,177 Simone on to the floor . " It doesn't mean
p02-090-04,176 anything , " Gay told herself desperately ,
p02-090-06,179 view and remembering the advice
p02-090-07,179 that Larry had given her , while she
p02-090-08,174 felt wretched beyond words .
d01-080-00,154 The bar was the commonest marking , but others
d01-080-01,153 were also used . Dots sometimes served in place of the
d01-080-02,156 bar , and there are cases where spacing is used as
d01-080-03,153 it is now used to mark a paragraph ending . Frequently
d01-080-04,152 paragraphos markings were omitted . C. H. Roberts is of
d01-080-05,155 the opinion that in the original of the Fourth Gospel
d01-080-06,155 some markings would be used , although which , it is
d01-080-07,151 impossible to say .
d01-085-01,154 the original of the Gospel would be unmarked . The
d01-085-02,155 original of the Gospel , whether written on a roll or codex ,
d01-085-03,152 whether paragraphed or not , would be laid out in
d01-085-04,152 columns . This is the invariable practice of ancient
d01-085-05,155 manuscripts . A common size of column would hold

p02-109-04,175 may consider him a man , I would say he was a
p02-109-06,175 weakly , " you don't know Gavin . " " I 've only met him
p02-109-07,175 today but I think I can safely say that I know
p02-109-08,175 him a great deal better than you do . "
n01-036-00,194 He was able to pick out towns , unrecognisable to the
n01-036-01,194 naked eye , obscured by the ground haze which even
n01-036-02,191 on the clearest night limited angular vision . He glanced
n01-036-03,190 at the speed recorder . It seemed almost incredible that
n01-036-04,187 the tiny white figure of 8.5 against which the needle
n01-036-05,186 was resting could really mean hundreds of knots .
d05-040-01,185 Laud made a positive approach . He set out to increase
d05-040-02,185 a sense of reverence . The Prayer Book was to be respected
d05-040-03,188 and so was the office of a bishop . Altars should be
d05-040-04,188 altars and not any broken down , transportable

m01-060-03,183 transcendent event , the exalted desire of all
m01-060-04,182 mankind through all ages ! The Kingdom of the
m01-060-05,180 Mind is at hand ! " He turned beaming eyes
m01-060-06,183 upward and shook his head slowly from
m01-060-07,185 side to side .
m01-104-00,193 " The Thetans , " he said , " are presumably here to
m01-104-01,192 take charge , as it were , of the minds of the
m01-104-02,192 people - who are probably falling all over them-
m01-104-03,194 selves in their zeal to get their orders and to carry
m01-104-04,190 them out . Just what these orders will be , we don't
m01-104-05,186 know . Now , because of prior hypnosis we have es-
m01-104-06,192 caped Thetan subjugation . This time . But we no
m01-104-07,195 longer have any immunity .
m01-121-00,196 There is just a hope that we may uncover
m01-121-01,196 some weakness , and find a way of fighting
m01-121-02,197 back at them . " Heather agreed , and suggested
m01-121-03,197 that they use Dan as a specimen demonstra-
m01-121-04,196 ting how the Thetan machinations had been
m01-121-05,194 working out . It occurred to Steve that this may
m01-121-06,198 not have been entirely an objective suggestion
m01-121-07,196 on her part ; but he thought it a good idea
n02-054-01,188 to understand all the whys and
n02-054-02,189 wherefores of your actions , " he said
n02-054-03,188 stiffly . " Still less to criticise you . "
n02-054-04,186 " Oh , drop that nonsense , Piers !
n02-054-05,188 Be yourself , " she exclaimed , with
n02-054-06,188 mounting exasperation . " Very well ! " He
n02-054-07,185 brought the jeep to a standstill in a rough
n02-054-08,183 path fringed and shaded by citrus trees .
n02-054-09,186 " If you want my true opinion I 'll give it .
n02-040-00,170 With an air of resignation he sent Judy , his
n02-040-01,170 Boxer , to the back , and made room for her
n02-040-02,169 beside him . " Is that all you want to do ? "
n02-040-03,168 he asked , letting in the clutch . " No ; I want
n02-040-04,164 to make you understand just what happened
n02-040-05,163 about this Balicou trip , " she returned
n02-040-06,167 coldly . " I 'm a little tired of being treated
n02-040-07,167 like an ineffective imbecile . "
n02-045-00,171 " And I 'm heartily sick of being constantly called
n02-045-01,168 to account for my manners , " he retorted .
n02-045-02,169 " What have I done wrong now ? I cover up for
n02-045-03,166 you the best way I can by getting hold of Jack
n02-045-04,163 to make the presentation , I run the damned
n02-045-05,163 party to the best of my ability - saying the
n02-045-06,168 sugary things you ought to have been there
n02-045-08,163 fault . "
n03-066-00,173 " That boy ! That damned fool boy ! What does he mean
n03-066-02,174 What does time mean when weighed against the life of
n03-066-03,174 two human beings ? " Not until he was certain that the
n03-066-04,172 yawl had rounded the rocky point instead of
n03-066-05,171 being flung against the huge boulders did the judge
n03-066-06,174 empty his lungs of stifling air and refill them
n03-066-07,174 with part of that howling northwest gale .

d04-047-00,171 Under such conditions without putting your
d04-047-01,170 mind together we cannot solve the further
d04-047-02,170 summons of destiny , to solve the economic
d04-047-03,170 problems . Hence says Rabbi Simeon ben
d04-047-04,170 Jochai ( Tanis 6a ) " if Israel does not fulfil
d04-047-05,169 the wish of the Lord , failing to serve the
d04-047-06,168 Lord God with all their visionary power ,
d04-047-07,170 the work will have to be done by each
d04-053-02,167 midst of plenty . Help will not be easily forth-
d04-053-03,168 coming for the people in need . They will
d04-053-04,166 think of the animals first ( which is of course
d04-053-05,164 our duty ) . Of course the individual will
d04-053-06,166 eat and be full but : " Take heed to yourself ,
d04-053-07,166 that your heart be not deceived , and 1ye turn

g04-052-00,183 It was very interesting to have the privilege of filling
g04-052-01,182 such a beautiful building with suitable fittings ; I made
g04-052-03,183 the architect , himself a fine artist . It is quite possible
g04-052-04,182 to put beautiful things into a beautiful church
g04-052-05,183 and yet spoil the building with ornaments unsui-
g04-052-06,182 table to the environs .
g03-049-00,182 Although his ideas were diametrically opposed
g03-049-01,182 to those of parsons he got on wonderfully well
g03-049-02,182 with them , particularly those who , like the Rev.
g03-049-04,182 the Church Socialist League , genuinely advocated
g03-049-05,182 socialism . With such men , who had the
g03-049-06,182 courage of their convictions and their
g03-049-07,182 Christianity , common ground could be found .
n02-104-00,182 " I know . Absurd as it may seem , I didn't want
n02-104-01,182 you to think badly of me . " She turned away
n02-104-02,182 from him to fondle Judy , who , sensing something
n02-104-03,182 amiss , was nudging her in the endeavour to
n02-104-05,172 if I had absolutely insisted on sailing at the
n02-104-07,182 have had it in for Guy .
n02-109-00,182 You see , it was , apparently , through a mistake
n02-109-01,182 on Guy's part that we missed seeing the
n02-109-02,182 flamingoes our first morning on the island . "
n02-109-03,182 " What harm could possibly have come to Forrest
n02-109-04,172 through Sir John's nonsense ? " Piers could
n02-109-05,172 hardly have spoken with more contempt .
n02-109-06,172 A bully like that respects anyone who
n02-109-07,182 dares to stand up to him . "
n02-114-00,182 Beryl tried to suppress the thought that this was
n02-114-01,182 precisely the remark she had made to Guy .
n02-114-03,182 your knowledge of all the affairs of the
n02-114-04,182 island I needn't tell you that Sir John
n02-114-05,182 Graybury is one of Mr. Hewson's most
n02-114-06,182 important customers . " " So what ? You 're not
n02-114-08,182 Forrest for behaving with ordinary moral
n02-114-09,182 courage !
n02-120-00,182 He 's quite capable of telling Sir John to take
n02-120-01,182 himself and his business to an unmention-
n02-120-02,182 able destination . " " There 's a difference
n02-120-03,182 between what a senior and a junior
n02-120-04,182 partner can do , " was her quick reply .
n02-120-05,182 " What they can bring off ! I 'll admit that .
n02-120-06,182 But Forrest might at least have tried . He 's
n02-120-07,182 pretty spineless ! "
n02-127-00,182 " You think you could have carried more weight
n02-127-01,182 with Sir John ? " she enquired cuttingly .
n02-127-04,182 as - as a grounded whale ! " He had to smile

n02-127-07,182 put her interests before my own .
r03-053-00,182 His voice was like his black and pin-stripe ,
r03-053-01,182 a grey superimposition of respectability over
r03-053-03,182 the result being somehow as ineffective , not
r03-053-04,182 just dusty-grey but muddy , slimy even .

r03-053-08,182 the fake friend of the family , like the
f07-000b-00,149 SOME years ago a contemporary philosopher
f07-000b-01,147 told us that there was nothing an Englishman
f07-000b-02,147 would not do ; nothing an American would not
f07-000b-03,149 say ; nothing an Italian would not sing ; no
f07-000b-04,144 music to which the Frenchman would not dance ;
f07-000b-05,142 nothing the German would not covet ; and
f07-000b-06,146 nothing the Chinese would not eat .
f07-002-00,149 It is not our purpose to discuss this dictum .
f07-002-01,147 Suffice to say that few of us stop to marvel at
f07-002-02,147 the progress of civilisation which allows a dish
f07-002-03,147 borrowed straight from the prehistoric . How
f07-002-04,143 many centuries ago , in some cave or hilly
f07-002-05,141 hide , did our forebears home from the chase
f07-002-06,143 hold forth from a spear the welcome gobbet of
f07-002-07,143 meat or fish burnt and roasted in the
f07-002-08,142 homely and protecting flame .
f07-006-00,147 How many centuries later did the mercenary in
f07-006-01,148 the Roman wars thus impale on pike or lance his
f07-006-02,146 evening meal . Later came the thrifty peasant ,
f07-006-03,146 later still the young Victorian buck adventuring
f07-006-04,145 in Paris , and even later our attractive young
f07-006-05,141 ladies toying with these primitive morsels in the
f07-006-06,143 gleam and glitter of our latter-day restaurants .
f07-009-00,148 And , if certain dishes and modes of food have
f07-009-01,147 persisted down the ages , the motive that preserved
f07-009-04,147 always been strong in mankind . The sharing of
f07-009-05,144 a meal in those earliest dangerous days was an
f07-009-06,147 admittance into an acquaintanceship far more
f07-009-07,146 important than the casual meetings of the present
f07-009-08,145 day ; the desire to share something more intimate
f07-009-09,144 than mere converse has always been there .
g02-059-00,191 In Chapter Two he gauged the nature of the heart's movements
g02-059-01,182 from the dissection of living animals , showing how these move-
g02-059-02,191 ments alternate with rests and are seen best in cold animals
g02-059-03,191 or in flagging warmer ones . At the time of its movement
g02-059-04,182 the heart becomes generally constricted , its walls thicken ,
g02-059-05,176 its ventricles decrease in volume and it expels its
g02-059-06,182 content of blood , appearing paler in so doing in animals
g02-059-07,176 such as serpents , frogs , and the like .

d01-049-01,172 case is that , in common with all his colleagues ,
d01-049-02,172 he has not , until now , been able to exhibit exactly
d01-049-03,172 how this enlargement was effected nor has he
d01-049-04,172 been able to explain the textual movements by
d01-049-05,182 showing that such changes are part of a
d01-049-06,182 simple and coherent plan . To understand how
d01-049-07,172 this is possible it is necessary to examine the
d01-049-08,172 text of the Gospel .
d01-052-00,182 THE Fourth Gospel was almost certainly
d01-052-01,182 written in Greek . A modern text of the
d01-052-02,182 Gospel represents the work of generations of
d01-052-03,182 scholars who have compared the many manu-
d01-052-04,182 scripts of John and worked out the version
d01-052-05,182 which is most likely to have been the original
d01-052-06,182 wording . It is not possible to establish any one
d01-052-07,182 text with absolute precision .
p02-135-00,191 Doc asked Lilyan to dance and once
p02-135-01,191 again Gay found herself alone at the table
p02-135-02,191 feeling self-conscious and awkward , sure that
p02-135-03,191 people were talking about the way Gavin
p02-135-04,182 was behaving since they had seen them
p02-135-05,182 dining together . She opened her bag
p02-135-06,191 to get out her compact and saw Grace's
p02-135-07,191 letter . She drew it out and opened it ,
p02-135-08,182 glad to be able to occupy herself .
f04-068-00,184 For all that , as far as England is concerned ,
f04-068-01,184 there have been only two occasions on
f04-068-02,186 which a body has been found in a tunnel
f04-068-06,182 occurred on the same line , although this time the
f04-068-07,183 victim was a woman .
f04-071-00,158 Though in the minds of most people there was
f04-071-01,156 no doubt that the woman had been the victim
f04-071-03,158 was not sufficient evidence to show whether
f04-071-07,157 and some time before midnight on September
f04-071-08,157 24 , 1905 , a Sunday , Sub-Inspector Peacock , of

n04-048-02,168 interest to The George , unhappily destroyed by German
n04-048-03,170 bombs during the last war . Having deposited his
n04-048-04,169 baggage and unpacked his overnight-bag he
n04-048-05,166 went in search of a drink . The lower bar was
n04-048-06,167 empty , save for the lady known by all habitue
n04-048-08,168 man who was staring moodily into a gin
n04-048-09,164 and tonic .
n04-052-01,168 must have been worth a great deal to the proprietors
n04-052-02,169 of the hotel . She greeted John , however , with less
n04-052-03,171 than her usual cordiality and flashed a warning
n04-052-04,166 glance at him . Evidently the other occupant
n04-052-05,166 of the bar was not 6persona grata . If her

n04-060-00,171 " Make it a large one , darling . I know the naval
n04-060-01,166 habits . ' Drink gin and call each other wallahs ,

n04-068-02,168 inherited desire to snub the man . If he did he
n04-068-03,169 would have to leave the bar and either sit in
n04-068-04,168 the lounge or return to his bedroom .
n04-068-05,166 Seaweed sensed his embarrassment and
n04-068-06,170 came to the rescue . " You haven't introduced

p02-027-00,182 All that was part of the past , she would put it behind her . She
p02-027-01,182 would never be jealous again , would even take Larry's advice and
p02-027-02,182 look the other way if need be . " I say ! " Gavin was looking over her

n02-151-00,158 Their air of smiling somnolence showed them
n02-151-02,160 celebrations , and their friendly welcome
n02-151-03,158 and warm sympathy , as she explained
n02-151-04,157 how she had come to miss the party ,
n02-151-05,159 made her send a complacent glance
n02-151-06,160 in Piers' direction . What a fuss-box the
