b05-017-01,168 took out a piece of paper , wrote his address on it and added :

c02-026-03,198 recording every wrinkle and drop of sweat

g06-037m-00,168 God grant , however , that I may be a false
g06-037m-01,166 prophet & that all may go well . Sir R. Peel
g06-037m-02,165 was here , I understand , but an express took
g06-037m-03,165 him off yesterday . ' While he was in Naples
g06-037m-04,166 there had opened a new chapter in the
g06-037m-05,166 history of Anglesey's unceasing search for an
g06-037m-06,164 effective alleviation of his painful malady .
g06-037m-07,164 None of the numerous conventional remedies to
g06-037m-08,165 which he had been subjected ever since the
g06-037m-09,163 symptoms had first shown themselves seventeen
g06-037m-10,163 years before had had the slightest effect .

c03-094b-05,152 always comically grotesque ; they were not asked
c03-094b-06,153 to modulate from their set moods but played
c03-094b-07,153 with proper efficiency and , in the case of Mr.
c03-094b-08,150 Richards , with lavish and suitably gaudy

b06-008-00,182 Yesterday West German Defence Minister ,
b06-008-01,182 Herr Strauss , started talks with the British
b06-008-02,182 Defence Minister , Mr. Watkinson . Their talks
b06-008-03,182 are another stage in the cloak operation ,
b06-008-04,172 1961 variety , by which the West German
b06-008-05,182 militarists are advancing their rearmament .
b06-008-06,172 Herr Strauss told the Daily Mail last October
b06-008-07,182 that his policy was to make his country

c03-087d-00,155 It went , perhaps , some distance beyond
c03-087d-01,153 most treatments of its subject by
c03-087d-02,153 attempting to generate a melodramatic
c03-087d-03,155 inevitability which left its central character
c03-087d-04,153 and the world around him in complete ,
c03-087d-05,153 unredeemable desolation . We could , perhaps ,
c03-087d-06,156 say whether or not the attempt succeeded
c03-087d-07,157 of we had a little more faith in the
c03-087d-08,154 way in which Mr. Ferris manipulated

c06-091-00,181 It 's hereabouts that the budge takes to the bottle , but I
c06-091-01,182 don't think it was through boredom . The film is funny enough

g06-050c-01,182 master at Ko"then , near Leipzig , asking for
g06-050c-02,182 advice . In doing so he described his distinguished
g06-050c-04,182 that he found Anglesey a strong , energetic man
g06-050c-05,182 with a gentle and charming character , even-tempered
g06-050c-06,182 and sedate , not easily irritated , patient and

g06-045j-00,182 In April of that year his first wife's brother-
g06-045j-01,182 in-law , the diplomatist Lord Ponsonby , had
g06-045j-02,182 written to advise Anglesey to give the system
g06-045j-03,182 a trial , adding that it was being cultivated
g06-045j-04,182 with extraordinary success in France and
g06-045j-05,182 Italy , and that he himself was being
g06-045j-06,182 treated under a doctor who had studied

g06-011a-02,182 much as his health permitted him to enjoy any-
g06-011a-03,182 thing . ' The Pearl ' , he wrote , ' is arrived , which

a01-049-04,176 The Senate Banking Committee , which is headed

a01-049-06,176 of Virginia - met today in closed session

b03-114-02,191 authorities ganged up to alter the habits
b03-114-03,184 of the people . That effort was to enforce
b03-114-04,182 the adoption of the twenty-four hour
b03-114-05,182 clock . Then , also , the B.B.C. were

a01-014-00,182 Sir Roy's United Federal Party is boycotting
a01-014-01,182 the London talks on the Protectorate's
a01-014-02,182 future . Said Mr. Nkumbula last night :
a01-014-03,182 " We want to discuss what to do if the

b01-027-00,182 THE Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh come home
b01-027-01,182 tonight from their tour in the East . The duke's
b01-027-03,189 have taken the headlines in this country .
b01-027-04,182 Nevertheless , the tour has been an immense
b01-027-05,182 success . The Queen has won a triumph . It
b01-027-06,182 would be pleasanter if such cruel and feudal
b01-027-07,182 performances as tiger and rhino hunts were
b01-027-08,182 dropped from future Royal programmes .
g05-087-00,162 Less than no response from the Russian side led
g05-087-01,162 one to fear that the event might well have the
g05-087-02,162 outcome that the Nazis evidently hoped might
g05-087-04,162 the setting up among the German population of a
g05-087-05,162 general system of " francs-tireurs " , to be named
g05-087-06,162 " Werewolves " .
g06-026m-00,182 A pleasant life truly ! ... It so happens that
g06-026m-01,182 I have an Italian who is perhaps the best
g06-026m-02,182 Valet de Chambre that ever was . But he has
g06-026m-03,182 not one word of English . ' While he was writing
g06-026m-04,182 this letter he heard of the fall of the Whigs , and
g06-026m-05,162 the temporary assumption of the government
g06-026m-06,162 by the Duke of Wellington .
r06-062-00,178 There is a curd of morning smoke and
r06-062-01,176 a muffled bell taps the sky . Here we
r06-062-02,178 stopped , as in fine weather we always
r06-062-03,176 stopped . Down below is the village of
r06-062-04,178 Cagnes , but between are pockets of
r06-062-05,175 heat and cold like the hands of
r06-062-06,179 friends or strangers , and a flurry of
r06-062-07,177 early smells , the dark bosoms of
r06-062-08,177 beech and the thin pine fingers
r06-062-09,173 kissed by the sun .
b05-062-00,186 He feels satisfaction " from the fact that my personality had been
b05-062-01,186 tested and weighed and not found wanting . " He feels like
b05-062-02,182 Pontius Pilate who washed his hands before the multitude
b05-062-03,186 saying : " I am innocent of the blood of this just person . "
b05-062-04,186 Like Dr. Globke , whom I interviewed the other day , Eichmann
b05-062-05,182 said :
f04-007-00,165 She had been struck several times with a blunt
f04-007-01,166 instrument , and her head was smashed in .
f04-007-02,166 There were signs of a violent struggle , blood
f04-007-04,166 of her broken umbrella . But a pair of bone
f04-007-05,164 cuff-links found in the compartment seemed
f04-007-06,164 to provide the only possible clue to the killer .
f04-020-00,173 But both purse and ticket , and the packages , were gone when the body
f04-020-01,173 was found at Waterloo . Neither the sisters nor Mr Berry thought it
f04-020-02,173 likely that she had been carrying much money . A porter at Hounslow
f04-020-03,171 supported the sister's statement that Elizabeth Camp had been alone in her
f04-020-04,171 compartment when the train left , but this did not help much , since it
f04-020-05,171 had made stops at nine stations before Waterloo .
b01-014-00,182 He holds that more pressure can be put on South
b01-014-01,182 Africa while she remains in the Commonwealth
b01-014-02,182 than could be exercised were she cut off from it .
b01-014-03,182 On the other hand , those who favour expulsion , inclu-
b01-014-04,176 ding African leaders , feel that nothing less than the
b01-014-05,176 shock of expulsion will weaken the grip of Dr.
b01-014-08,176 the apartheid policy .
c04-128-00,177 " I feel I 've done all I can at the B B C , " he
c04-128-01,175 told me . " We mutually agreed to part . "

e02-000-01,189 legs , and in reproduction period pieces they
e02-000-02,189 are frequently used . The simpler varieties are
e02-000-03,191 extremely easy to work , the four sides being
e02-000-05,182 the more elaborate varieties , however , a toe is
e02-000-06,187 worked in the solid , and this certainly
e02-000-07,189 complicates the operation .
c03-087c-00,186 It went , perhaps , some distance beyond most treatments
c03-087c-01,187 of its subject by attempting to generate a melo-
c03-087c-02,185 dramatic inevitability which left its central character
c03-087c-03,184 and the world around him in complete , unredee-
c03-087c-04,184 mable desolation . We could , perhaps , say whether
c03-087c-05,183 or not the attempt succeeded if we had a
c03-087c-06,187 little more faith in the way in which Mr.

e02-117-02,189 Providing this is sound , some perfectly good
e02-117-03,190 work can be done on it , but the usual problems
e02-117-05,189 place for tools . The combined bench top and
e02-117-06,195 tool cupboard shown here has been specially
e02-117-07,195 designed and made for WOODWORKER

a03-027-00,203 A correspondent who travelled yesterday to within
a03-027-01,203 a few miles of Vang Vieng was told by officers that

a03-027-04,203 and # his Cabinet out in the grass roots making
a03-027-05,203 160 speeches in 80 constituencies in 10 days , the Liberal
a03-027-06,203 Party are holding a national conference here with
a03-027-07,216 some 2,000 delegates , the biggest gathering since 1958
a03-027-08,203 when Mr. Lester Pearson was chosen as party
a03-027-09,203 leader .
c02-012-00,181 Every unnecessary detail , all superfluous local
c02-012-01,183 colouring must be eliminated . He does not

a03-066-01,203 remove these doubts , and to persuade the
a03-066-02,203 Federal Government that the financial burden
a03-066-03,203 involved is really worth while , at a time when
a03-066-04,205 any increase in budgetary commitments
a03-066-05,203 would almost certainly involve a corresponding
a03-066-06,205 rise in taxation - something no one is prepared
a03-066-07,216 to contemplate in an election year .
a01-038-00,182 Mr. Macleod thought the two Rhodesian
a01-038-01,182 parties had refused to attend the talks

r06-115-00,183 Catherine looked at the books lying

r06-115-08,183 frowning face as she turned the
r06-115-09,183 pages of Babel , for she was determined
r06-115-10,181 to let nothing get between her and

c06-106-01,186 ture of Julie Newmar for con-
c06-106-03,188 mission in mind . She , " younger ,
c06-106-05,186 intelligent " than the wife ( as she
c06-106-06,188 soon tells her ) , wants to have the

a01-053u-01,170 alleged association with organisations black-
a01-053u-02,170 listed by the Government . Immediately Mr.
a01-053u-03,170 Kennedy rushed a letter to Senator Robertson
a01-053u-04,167 saying the Federal Bureau of Investigation had
a01-053u-05,169 reported on Mr. Weaver . He believed
a01-053u-06,168 he would perform " outstanding service "
a01-053u-07,169 in his post . Senator Robertson's committee
a01-053u-08,168 has to pass Mr. Weaver's nomination before it
a01-053u-09,169 can be considered by the full Senate .
a06-014-00,163 They nodded at each other and Sir Edward
a06-014-01,163 rose to say that the Chancellor would bear
a06-014-03,160 Treasury experts are already working on
a06-014-04,163 the scheme . Profits of genuine investors
a06-014-05,160 in industry will not be affected , but only
a06-014-06,160 quick in-and-out speculator deals .
a06-014-07,160 FRANK FOULKES , Communist president
a06-014-08,160 of the ETU , refused yesterday to
a06-014-09,160 " commit suicide " at the TUC's
a06-014-10,156 invitation .
a06-152-01,182 determination is the intention to impose
a06-152-02,182 on East Germany the regime existing in
a06-152-03,182 West Germany . REFUGEES are pouring out
a06-152-04,182 # of East Germany into West
a06-152-05,182 Berlin faster than ever . Mr. K's latest
a06-152-06,182 speech scared 1,157 East Germans to
a06-152-07,182 cross into West Berlin's reception centre
a06-152-08,182 DURING MONDAY NIGHT . And officials
a06-152-09,182 expect the total to leap to
a06-152-10,182 3,000 a day .
c03-084e-00,179 Mr. Bryan Stonehouse's production is quietly
c03-084e-01,180 effective , giving full value to the formal elements
c03-084e-02,179 of Betti's writing without over-emphasizing
c03-084e-03,179 them . Last night's play in the " Play of the
c03-084e-05,179 Fall , by Mr. Paul Ferris , was a morality on
c03-084e-06,180 the not unfamiliar theme of the destructive
c03-084e-07,179 power of unbridled ambition .
e01-102-00,183 Remember that texture plays an important part in
e01-102-01,181 the beauty of crochet . The finer mercerised threads
e01-102-02,181 are more effective for the delicate designs used for
e01-102-03,180 tablecloths , doilies , edgings and accessories , while
e01-102-04,177 the heavier threads are used for bedspreads ,
e01-102-05,177 chairbacks , luncheon mats , etc. Crochet hooks
e01-102-06,179 are made of steel , composition or bone . Steel
e01-102-07,180 crochet hooks range in size from number 3/0 ,
e01-102-08,175 the largest , to number 8 , the smallest .
g06-037j-00,182 God grant , however , that I may be a false
g06-037j-01,182 prophet & that all may go well . Sir R. Peel
g06-037j-02,182 was here , I understand , but an express took
g06-037j-03,182 him off yesterday . '
g06-037j-04,182 While he was in Naples there had opened a
g06-037j-05,182 new chapter in the history of Anglesey's
g06-037j-06,182 unceasing search for an effective alleviation
g06-037j-07,182 of his painful malady . None of the numer-
g06-037j-08,182 ous conventional remedies to which he had
g06-037j-09,182 been subjected ever since the symptoms
g06-045b-00,166 In April of that year his first wife's
g06-045b-01,163 brother-in-law , the diplomatist Lord
g06-045b-02,163 Ponsonby , had written to advise Anglesey to
g06-045b-03,163 give the system a trial , adding that it
g06-045b-04,163 was being cultivated with extraordinary
g06-045b-05,161 success in France and Italy , and that
g06-045b-06,160 he himself was being treated under a
g06-045b-07,159 doctor who had studied under its
g06-045b-08,159 founder , the aged Dr. Samuel
g06-045b-09,155 Hahnemann .
g06-031l-00,186 ' What a frightful event ! ' he wrote . ' I tremble ! What
g06-031l-01,186 infatuation ! Personally I am indifferent , but I really tremble
g06-031l-02,182 for my country ! I may be mistaken , 1tho' I cannot but
g06-031l-03,182 fear that the exasperation of the People will be so
g06-031l-04,182 great at the return of Ultratoryism , that the Commons
g06-031l-05,182 House upon a dissolution , which must be had , will be a
r02-127-00,176 Cecil wriggled irritably under the misplaced management
r02-127-01,176 of a mother who had failed to realise that a son
r02-127-02,182 who is nearly bald is no longer a baby . He started to
r02-127-03,182 climb the stairs , stamping with unnecessary vigour upon
r02-127-04,182 the treads . ' And don't wipe the dirt off on the
r02-127-05,182 towel like you did yesterday .
g06-026j-00,182 A pleasant life truly ! ... It so happens that
g06-026j-01,182 I have an Italian who is perhaps the best
g06-026j-04,182 writing this letter he heard of the fall of
g06-026j-05,182 the Whigs , and the temporary assumption of
g06-026j-06,182 the government by the Duke of Wellington .
b01-084-00,172 That was the first point that Mr. Hammarskjold
b01-084-02,172 3,000 men , who must take about a fortnight to arrive .
b01-084-03,172 If the UN forces were thick enough on the ground ,
b01-084-05,172 happen . THE UN's ability to keep peace depends
b01-084-06,172 simply on adequate support by the nations
b01-084-07,172 which have set their hands to this plough .
b05-067-00,186 " I drew a certain solace from the fact that I did what I
b05-067-02,186 when he pleads that he was only a small unit on the base
b05-067-03,186 of the triangle that led to Hitler , Himmler , Hess and Goering
b05-067-04,182 at the apex . In examination he betrayed an expert and
b05-067-05,182 intimate knowledge of every link in the chain of command that
b05-067-06,186 led to the top .
h04-025-00,173 For all foods the range was from 3.6 per cent above the national average
h04-025-01,171 in younger two-adult households to 4.8 per cent below in families with
h04-025-02,172 four or more children , compared with +3.6 to -5.4 per cent in 1958
h04-025-03,171 and +2.8 to -2.6 per cent in 1957 . As with the price of energy index ,
h04-025-04,168 the only noteworthy change was for households with three children ,
h04-025-05,171 in which the index fell by 1.8 to 97.5 per cent of the average for
h04-025-06,171 all households in the sample .
a02-046-01,189 bably the toughest man in Mr. Nkrumah's team ,
a02-046-02,189 drove up to the Kingsway Stores and faced the
a02-046-03,189 demonstrators , most of them shopgirls in overalls .
a02-046-04,182 " If you have not dispersed by ten o'clock , " he
a02-046-05,182 told them , ' the police will act . ' At five to ten
a02-046-06,189 a posse of police arrived and in less than
a02-046-07,189 two minutes the crowd had gone .
c04-061-00,169 Carole Shelley as the newly-wed and Larry Noble
c04-061-01,174 as Smiler Perkins were the most laughable . They
c04-061-02,174 alone used a sharp edge to their humour and cut
c04-061-04,165 it was accidental - I hope not . If ever a bag of
c04-061-05,164 humour needed a thorough shaking up the Whitehall
g06-011h-00,179 By the end of the month he still delighted in Naples .
g06-011h-01,179 He told Cloncurry that he enjoyed it as much as
g06-011h-02,181 his health permitted him to enjoy anything . ' The
g06-011h-03,184 Pearl ' , he wrote , ' is arrived , which is a great
g06-011h-04,180 resource . Vesuvius seems to be tired ; he is
g06-011h-06,177 what a busy town . At Rome , every other man
g06-011h-08,178 the soldier - a favourable change in my eye ,
g06-011h-09,177 particularly as the troops are very fine . '
a01-068u-00,168 And they are unimpressed by the Germans' claim
a01-068u-01,169 that they cannot pay more than 357million
a01-068u-02,170 without upsetting their own economy . The
a01-068u-03,170 Americans say Germany is having it too
a01-068u-04,166 good and is not paying for the past
a01-068u-05,168 or for the present . The Adenauer Government
a01-068u-06,168 flatly rejected attempts by the Eisenhower
a01-068u-07,169 Government to get them to pay a regular
a01-068u-08,167 sum towards the cost of keeping American
a01-068u-09,167 troops in Germany .
b01-073-00,172 The first reaction of the Sudanese
b01-073-01,172 Government was to denounce the United
b01-073-03,172 to say that its 400 troops in the Congo
b01-073-04,162 would be taken home . The reaction can be
b01-073-05,162 understood . The Sudan's concern for its
b01-073-06,172 men is natural . But this could hardly be
b01-073-07,162 a # dignified exit . IF the UN is
b01-073-08,172 blamed for being weak , it would be
b01-073-09,172 more logical to send in more men ,
b01-073-10,172 not weaken it further by desertion .
g06-047a-00,182 This remarkable man of medicine , whom Sir Francis
g06-047a-01,182 Burdett described to Anglesey a year or two later
g06-047a-02,182 as ' more like a God upon earth than a human
g06-047a-05,182 of Europe . One of these was the Neapolitan ,
g06-047a-06,182 Dr Giuseppe Mauro , whom Anglesey consulted
g06-047a-07,182 in # May 1834 .
c03-021e-00,179 In Fanny the pregnant girl is befriended
c03-021e-01,179 by an old man . Here it is a young homo-
c03-021e-02,179 sexual , estranged from women but yet moved
c03-021e-03,179 by a strong maternal instinct to the unborn
c03-021e-04,177 child as much as to the expectant mother ,
c03-021e-05,176 who acts as a protector and comforter to
c03-021e-06,178 her in her hour of need . He shares her room
c03-021e-07,179 and gives her his forlorn gift of com-
c03-021e-08,177 panionship and sympathy - " you need someone
c03-021e-09,177 to love you while you are looking for
r02-060-01,182 more and came up with two
r02-060-02,182 paper-clips . After a few seconds
r02-060-03,182 of twisting , he roughly thrust a
r02-060-04,176 bent wire loop into the lock and
r02-060-05,176 waggled it around vigorously .
r02-060-06,182 There was a click and the
r02-060-07,182 briefcase opened . Cecil thrust an
r02-060-10,182 pound notes .
g04-026-00,173 First of all simple part-songs : I found only one member who had
g04-026-01,174 any idea of reading music . This was the village doctor who was an
g04-026-02,172 old school friend at Clifton . He could sustain the tenor part quite well
g04-026-03,170 and lead the others . As for basses and altos the conductor had to
g04-026-04,168 teach by singing the parts with them . It was very amusing , and by
g04-026-05,168 the end of a few months an enthusiastic choir of men and women
g04-026-06,170 could render simple part-singing tolerably well .
b06-090-00,190 Such a policy would unite the whole movement
b06-090-01,189 and lay the basis for the defeat of the
b06-090-02,190 present Tory Government , which has become a
b06-090-03,189 real menace to the British people both in
b06-090-04,190 home and foreign policy . It is quite evident
b06-090-05,188 that the movement will go on record against
b06-090-06,189 the Polaris base and facilities for German bases
b06-042-00,203 A policy which breaks with military
b06-042-01,203 alliances like Nato and seeks friendship
b06-042-02,203 with the Soviet Union can prevent another
b06-042-03,203 betrayal like that of the '30s . Shipbuilding

b06-042-08,189 policy decisions established at the Scar-
b06-042-09,189 borough Labour Party Conference I am
b06-042-10,191 appalled at the character of the current
c03-084f-00,174 Mr. Bryan Stonehouse's production is
c03-084f-02,175 formal elements of Betti's writing without
c03-084f-03,171 over-emphasizing them . Last night's play

c03-084f-08,168 of unbridled ambition .
e01-062-00,175 In the home , crochet lace can be used to make
e01-062-01,181 tablecloths , traycloths and runners , and edgings
e01-062-02,179 from heavy to fine can fulfil a variety of
e01-062-03,179 functions . The art of crochet is not difficult and
e01-062-04,175 it is reasonably quick to work . In the following
e01-062-05,173 pages simple diagrams and instructions are given
e01-062-06,178 to enable the beginner to master all the essential
e01-062-07,177 crochet stitches .
r06-111-00,181 Catherine lives in a white house
r06-111-02,183 of the river . She helped me clean up my
r06-111-03,183 flat with a devotion which said that
r06-111-04,184 she felt small flats were altogether more
r06-111-05,181 romantic than large houses . We drank
r06-111-06,182 tea , and talked mainly about Philip , who ,

b06-023-00,172 Alongside these divisions a force of over 600
b06-023-01,172 Starfighters provided by the Americans is growing
b06-023-02,172 up . These " fighters " are in fact fighter bombers
b06-023-03,172 which could launch an atomic attack on
b06-023-04,172 Eastern Europe . By 1963 the Germans plan to have
b06-023-05,172 nine missile battalions , with 288 missiles and
b06-023-06,172 36 firing ramps , including weapons like Matador
b06-023-07,172 ( range 950 miles ) , also provided by the Americans .
g06-026l-00,186 A pleasant life truly ! ... It so happens that I have an
g06-026l-01,186 Italian who is perhaps the best Valet de Chambre that
g06-026l-02,186 ever was . But he has not one word of English . '
g06-026l-03,186 While he was writing this letter he heard of the fall of the
g06-026l-04,186 Whigs , and the temporary assumption of the government
g06-026l-05,182 by the Duke of Wellington .
e04-000-00,187 HERE is a project that will be welcomed by the
e04-000-01,185 family man or father-to-be . Unlike many
e04-000-02,183 commercial articles , this chair is solidly built and
e04-000-03,182 capable of withstanding the heavy handling of the
e04-000-04,182 most destructive youngster . Almost any available
e04-000-05,177 timber can be used but Parana pine is
e04-000-06,182 recommended , being cheap , easy to work , and
e04-000-07,181 taking a good finish .
a03-037-00,182 Last year saw the defeat of two Conservative
a03-037-01,176 provincial governments , Quebec and New Brunswick , and
a03-037-02,176 in the four federal by-elections last October the party
a03-037-03,176 fared badly . They are now faced with four other by-
a03-037-04,176 elections , one at Esquimalt Saanich , British Columbia ,
a03-037-05,176 one in Leeds , Ontario , and the other two in the
a03-037-06,176 Maritimes - Restigouche Madawaska , New Brunswick ,

k04-017-00,179 ' Are you enjoying yourself , Olimpia ? ' she
k04-017-02,176 her fan , in passing ; but she did not wait for
k04-017-03,177 the answer . Disturbed by vague uneasiness , she
k04-017-04,176 was wondering whether Olimpia had been
k04-017-05,174 watching her talk with Orsini . Surely she
k04-017-06,173 could not have overheard anything they
k04-017-08,173 on that point , for she was certain no one
k04-017-09,174 had been standing near them .
g06-047g-01,182 Burdett described to Anglesey a year or two later as
g06-047g-02,182 ' more like a God upon earth than a human being ' , had an
g06-047g-03,182 increasing number of disciples among unorthodox medical
g06-047g-04,182 men in the cities of Europe . One of these was the Neapolitan ,
g06-047g-05,182 Dr Giuseppe Mauro , whom Anglesey consulted in May 1834 .
r02-137-01,176 what it 's all about . ' Cecil halted in
r02-137-02,176 mid-step near the top of the stairs and
r02-137-05,176 turning round . She pointed to the
r02-137-07,176 irritable . You thought that I 'd think

a02-057-02,191 people " on no pretext whatsoever , except
a02-057-03,191 to pass the time of day " ; Supporters had
a02-057-04,182 been warned - one that his connection
a02-057-06,191 that anti-apartheid agitation was
a02-057-07,185 all right , but support for the committee
g06-045l-00,186 In April of that year his first wife's brother-in-law , the
g06-045l-01,186 diplomatist Lord Ponsonby , had written to advise Anglesey

g06-045l-06,182 Dr. Samuel Hahnemann .
a05-116-00,185 This was too reminiscent of the nursemaid
a05-116-01,188 and her illegitimate baby . For the most
a05-116-02,186 part , Mr. Godber muttered his way
a05-116-03,186 through a cliche-ridden Foreign Office
a05-116-04,186 brief . He resembles the elephant seal , an
a05-116-05,182 # otherwise endearing creature whose
a05-116-06,180 articulation is limited , we are told , to a
a05-116-07,183 series of heavy sighs . Sir Lynn Ungoed-
n02-146-00,185 She was tempted to laugh , but it was as though that barb still stuck
n02-146-01,187 in her quivering flesh . " You 've an answer - of sorts - for everything , " she
n02-146-02,187 said shortly . " Personally I 've no more to say , so I suggest we get
n02-146-03,187 along . " To her great relief they arrived at the cluster of little houses
n02-146-06,186 incredibly ancient car , surrounded by innumerable friends and relatives .
c03-094c-01,186 pushing , Miss Sheila Allen his wife , always palely
c03-094c-02,186 appealing , Mr. James Maxwell , the editor , always
c03-094c-03,186 comically abashed by the events , and Mr. Aubrey
c03-094c-04,185 Richards , the father-in-law , always comically
c03-094c-05,183 grotesque ; they were not asked to modulate from
c03-094c-06,186 their set moods but played with proper effi-
c03-094c-07,186 ciency and , in the case of Mr. Richards , with
c03-094c-08,183 lavish and suitably gaudy colour .
f04-016-00,147 Elizabeth had left Hammersmith in the late afternoon ,
f04-016-02,147 she had tea with her other sister , and then
f04-016-03,148 went to catch the 7.42 . Her sister saw her

f04-016-05,145 her packages . This sister was able to establish
f04-016-06,145 that she had carried a green purse and
f04-016-07,146 had bought a railway ticket .
b04-103-02,186 ponder how their gardening tools are mysteriously
b04-103-03,186 returned to the shed ; their books tidied ; and often ,
b04-103-04,188 even their shoes cleaned ? How wonderful if they
a01-020x-00,151 Mr. Macleod went on with the conference at
a01-020x-01,153 Lancaster House despite the crisis which had
a01-020x-02,157 blown up . He has now revealed his full plans
a01-020x-03,152 to the Africans and Liberals attending . These
a01-020x-04,147 plans do not give the Africans the overall majo-
a01-020x-05,155 rity they are seeking . African delegates are
a01-020x-06,157 studying them today . The conference will meet
a01-020x-07,153 to discuss the function of a proposed House
a01-020x-08,152 of Chiefs .
a01-058x-00,174 PRESIDENT KENNEDY is ready to get
a01-058x-01,176 tough over West Germany's cash offer to
a01-058x-02,174 help America's balance of payments position
a01-058x-03,174 He said bluntly in Washington yesterday
a01-058x-04,173 that the offer - 357million - was not good
a01-058x-05,164 enough . And he indicated that his
a01-058x-06,177 Government would try to get Germany to
a01-058x-07,177 pay more . He did not mention personal
a01-058x-08,170 talks with Dr. Adenauer , the West
a01-058x-09,167 German Chancellor .
a06-039-00,191 " The whole naval might of the Soviet
a06-039-01,188 Union can be seen here - a truly inspiring
a06-039-02,188 and proud sight , " said Moscow radio's
a06-039-03,186 commentator . The parade was reviewed by
a06-039-04,183 Marshal Andrei Grechko , commanding the

a02-053-01,191 Minister , to do the honours as host , in which capacity
a02-053-02,185 he held a reception tonight in Accra's Ambassador
a02-053-03,182 Hotel . POLICE , on direct orders from the Cabinet , are
a02-053-04,182 openly intimidating members of Earl Russell's nuclear-
a02-053-05,191 disarming Committee of 100 , the Committee claimed
a02-053-06,185 yesterday . It said pressure was being put on
a02-053-07,182 members and associates all over the country .
f03-182-00,203 But that 's a terrible way to begin ! Why tell them you
f03-182-01,203 are a novice ? It 's their interest you want - not their
f03-182-02,203 sympathy . And you want to get it from the word
f03-182-04,203 vision keeps people at home . But you , at any
f03-182-05,203 rate , have proved that wrong . And they say , too ,
f03-182-06,203 that television makes its appeal to those of lesser
a02-082-00,162 He cited cases in which hundreds of UNIP supporters
a02-082-01,163 had been arrested or convicted since last year on
a02-082-02,163 charges of creating disturbances . During the first
a02-082-03,163 three weeks of the present trouble 287 incidents
a02-082-04,157 had been reported in Northern Rhodesia . More
a02-082-05,157 than 500 people - 167 of them members of
a02-082-06,162 the UNIP - were convicted last month in the
a02-082-07,162 Northern Province alone .
a04-047-00,172 Addressing the annual congress of the National Union
a04-047-01,172 of General and Municipal Workers , he said he felt
a04-047-02,172 sure the Labour movement was coming round in
a04-047-03,172 support of his views . Obviously conscious of the fierce and
a04-047-04,172 widespread resentment over the U.S. Polaris base in
a04-047-05,172 Britain , Mr. Gaitskell said that he even noticed that
a04-047-06,172 supporters of unilateral nuclear disarmament were changing
a04-047-07,172 their tactics by switching most of their emphasis on
a04-047-08,165 to the missile .
r03-026-00,186 Fortunately , however , the fashion for Victorian
r03-026-01,186 architecture which Mr. John Betjeman had
r03-026-02,186 started several decades before had caught on
r03-026-03,186 at last and therefore saved the situation for
r03-026-04,182 the affluent middle-class , who now had plenty
r03-026-06,186 Serena discovered , and more , but in stages . For the
r03-026-07,186 first thing she did was to make an offer
r03-026-10,186 small back yard , newly dec. , near shops and tube
b05-045-00,162 From being an assembler in an aircraft
b05-045-01,162 factory to becoming a paint sprayer in
b05-045-02,162 a ceramic factory , he can be qualified
b05-045-03,162 for a completely new job in less time
b05-045-04,162 than it takes to say " Tolpuddle
b05-045-07,162 with ball , bats and wickets between
b05-045-08,162 # two sides consisting of eleven players
b05-045-09,162 each . " Not so , dear Oxford Dictionary .
a06-075-00,157 " After long and earnest consideration , Her
a06-075-01,157 Majesty's Government have come to the
a06-075-02,157 conclusion that it would be right for
a06-075-03,157 Britain to make a formal application . .
a06-075-04,157 for negotiations with a view to joining
a06-075-05,157 the Community . " At this point , Mr. Paul
a06-075-06,157 Williams ( Cons. , Sunderland ) called out
a06-075-07,157 " Shame . " Mr. Williams is a close
a06-075-08,157 associate of Mr. Fell .
c02-000-00,155 AFTER ten days of intermittent , near fatal
c02-000-01,162 ennui , the eleventh Berlin International
c02-000-02,166 Film Festival was suddenly jolted back to
c02-000-03,166 life by two extraordinary films , Bernhard
c02-000-04,172 Wicki's " Das Wunder des Malachias " ( " The
c02-000-05,177 Miracle of Father Malachias " ) and Michael-
c02-000-06,178 angelo Antonioni's " La Notte . " The num-
c02-000-07,178 ber of German film directors who have
c02-000-08,177 made first rate works in the last 25 years
c02-000-09,182 can be counted on the fingers of one
a01-117u-00,170 In fact , the Tories made it worse now
a01-117u-01,172 for the sick and needy than Labour had
a01-117u-02,170 to make it in 1950 . And as a percentage
a01-117u-03,171 of social service expenditure , health had
a01-117u-04,170 fallen from 28.5 to 23.1 per cent. Then
a01-117u-05,171 Mr. Brown swung his attack directly to
a01-117u-06,172 the unsmiling Mr. Powell . He demanded
a01-117u-07,171 that instead of taking it out of the
a01-117u-08,169 patients Mr. Powell should take ruthless
a01-117u-09,171 action against the drug making industry , #
a01-117u-10,170 whose profits had risen by up to 400 per
f02-036-00,189 The Lord Provost , having studied the report on ' The Morale and
f02-036-02,189 raised were of considerable importance to the citizens of
f02-036-03,189 Glasgow and warranted further study , set an informal
f02-036-04,189 committee representative of bodies particularly concerned with
f02-036-05,189 the welfare of older people to examine the report and
f02-036-06,189 its implications and to consider the advisability of
f02-036-07,191 arranging a Conference on Preparation for and
f02-036-08,189 Occupational Activities on Retirement .
g06-045a-00,182 In April of that year his first wife's brother-in-law ,
g06-045a-01,182 the diplomatist Lord Ponsonby , had written to
g06-045a-02,182 advise Anglesey to give the system a trial , adding
g06-045a-03,182 that it was being cultivated with extraordinary
g06-045a-04,182 success in France and Italy , and that he
g06-045a-05,182 himself was being treated under a doctor who
g06-045a-06,182 had studied under its founder , the aged
g06-045a-07,182 Dr. Samuel Hahnemann .
b01-062-00,162 Should the Herald publish such advertisements ?
b01-062-01,162 This is a difficult question . It would obviously
b01-062-02,162 be wrong to refuse all political advertisements with
b01-062-04,162 contains statements whose factual truth is
b01-062-05,162 doubtful , or where the total content would be
b01-062-06,162 deeply repugnant to our readers , it is right to
b01-062-07,162 exercise editorial discretion . The MRA
b01-062-08,162 advertisement falls into neither category , though
b01-062-09,162 many readers will dislike it .
g06-026k-00,182 A pleasant life truly ! ... It so happens that I have
g06-026k-01,182 an Italian who is perhaps the best Valet de
g06-026k-02,182 Chambre that ever was . But he has not one word
g06-026k-03,182 of English . ' While he was writing this letter he
g06-026k-04,182 heard of the fall of the Whigs , and the temporary
g06-026k-05,182 assumption of the government by the Duke of
g06-026k-06,182 Wellington .
b01-057-00,162 A CURIOUS advertisement on page nine , paid
b01-057-01,162 for by that curious body Moral Re-Armament .
b01-057-02,162 Those who lend their names to this kind of
b01-057-03,152 advertisement are worthy people , a little innocent
b01-057-04,152 of politics , perhaps , or carried away by the
b01-057-05,162 idea that moral regeneration would solve
b01-057-06,162 all our problems . So it would . While we are
b01-057-07,162 waiting for the millenium , however , most of us
b01-057-08,162 would prefer to put our hopes for earthly justice in
b01-057-09,162 instruments of democracy , such as trade unions
b01-057-10,162 and our local and national Parliaments .
c02-049-00,176 Strangely enough , the Berlin audience received
c02-049-01,172 the film with extreme coolness , much preferring
c02-049-02,173 Jean-Luc Godard's disappointing " Une Femme
c02-049-05,170 worst aspects of the American cinema . From
c02-049-06,171 a brilliantly funny start , the work fizzles
c02-049-08,168 and personal jokes incomprehensible to the
c02-049-09,169 uninitiated ( including four plugs for Charles
c02-049-10,169 Aznavour ) .
a01-043u-00,169 Informal talks at Lancaster House will
a01-043u-01,168 resume today . PRESIDENT KENNEDY today
a01-043u-02,170 defended the appointment of a Negro as
a01-043u-03,171 his Housing Minister . It has aroused strong
a01-043u-04,168 opposition from the anti-Negro senators of the
a01-043u-05,169 Deep South . The negro is Mr. Robert #
a01-043u-06,169 Weaver of New York . One of his tasks will
a01-043u-07,170 be to see there is no racial discrimination
a01-043u-08,169 in Government and State housing
a01-043u-09,166 projects .
g06-037b-00,162 God grant , however , that I may be a
g06-037b-01,162 false prophet & that all may go well .
g06-037b-02,162 Sir R. Peel was here , I understand , but
g06-037b-03,162 an express took him off yesterday . '
g06-037b-04,162 While he was in Naples there had opened
g06-037b-05,162 a new chapter in the history of
g06-037b-06,162 Anglesey's unceasing search for an effective
g06-037b-07,162 alleviation of his painful malady . None
g06-037b-08,162 of the numerous conventional remedies
g06-037b-09,162 to which he had been subjected ever
r03-007-00,191 It was a nakedness of nai"vety to be
r03-007-01,191 clothed leaf by leaf with the disappointment
r03-007-02,191 of experience . Her first illusion consisted in
r03-007-03,191 the belief that all she need do was to go to
r03-007-04,182 an agent , visit half a dozen houses in one
r03-007-05,182 day , choose one , make an offer , put it in
r03-007-06,191 the hands of a lawyer and go away on her
r03-007-07,191 holiday while the whole transaction was
r03-007-08,182 put through .
b02-097-00,149 To be able to say " New York next week " is an
b02-097-01,153 important advance . We must not be overconfident
b02-097-02,157 that this # meeting will lead on to further
b02-097-03,162 and decisive ones ; but without it , we could not
b02-097-04,159 look for them . Federal Germany votes tomorrow
b02-097-05,162 and not a day too soon . There can seldom have
b02-097-06,167 been an election campaign which more people
b02-097-07,168 in and out of the country wanted to see over
b02-097-08,164 and done with .
e04-114-00,183 Clean up with the plane ready for the bottom ,
e04-114-02,180 trifle ; this can be cleaned up later . As you are
e04-114-03,181 screwing and gluing this piece to the chines it is
e04-114-04,177 necessary to be careful not to miss the chine with
e04-114-05,178 the screws . I prefer spacing screws 3 in. apart for
e04-114-06,182 the bottom , both for screwing to the chines and
e04-114-07,178 the bottom shaped transom facing .
b01-089-00,172 The big Powers involved in the Cold War
b01-089-01,172 must of course keep out . The Americans were
b01-089-02,172 justified in diverting naval ships in case
b01-089-04,172 stressed that there was no intention to intervene
b01-089-05,172 in fighting . Yesterday the ships turned away
b01-089-07,172 It is to be hoped that the UN will be
b01-089-08,172 re-established in their port by negotiation
b01-089-09,172 and that there will be no more outrages .
a01-091u-00,169 The result of the vote was not in doubt .
a01-091u-01,172 For the Tories were massed in answer to
a01-091u-02,170 their whips to defeat a censure motion
a01-091u-03,172 on the Government for " undermining the
a01-091u-04,169 Health Service " and placing heavy burdens
a01-091u-05,169 on those least able to bear them . Mr.
a01-091u-06,168 Brown declared that the policy under
a01-091u-07,170 censure was monstrous . It had offended
a01-091u-08,169 many people far beyond the ranks of
a01-091u-09,169 Labour supporters .
g06-050f-00,182 Mauro's first action was to write to his revered master at Ko"then ,
g06-050f-01,182 near Leipzig , asking for advice . In doing so he described his
g06-050f-02,182 distinguished patient and his symptoms . He told Hahnemann that he
g06-050f-03,182 found Anglesey a strong , energetic man with a gentle and charming
g06-050f-04,182 character , even-tempered and sedate , not easily irritated , patient and
g06-050f-05,182 persevering , ' but he appears to despair of ever being cured . '
a03-054-00,160 Everything is being done to promote
a03-054-01,160 a new image . Certainly , he is now a
a03-054-02,160 much lessly trounced by Mr. Diefen-
a03-054-03,160 baker in the House in those early
a03-054-04,160 days . It has been a hard road back
a03-054-06,160 ammunition given him by the Gov-
a03-054-07,160 ernment in recent sessions , he is
a03-054-09,160 assurance and is a match for the
a03-054-10,160 Prime Minister across the floor .
a02-008-00,182 Seven Commonwealth countries have told Mr. Sandys ,
a02-008-01,182 Commonwealth Relations Secretary , that they wish to be kept
a02-008-02,183 in touch in London . Three of them - Canada , Australia ,
a02-008-03,180 New Zealand - will have strong delegations at an opening
a02-008-04,177 meeting in London on Monday . Once the Common
a02-008-05,175 Market's Council of Ministers draws up the procedure
a02-008-07,181 countries can arrange for observers to advise the British
a02-008-08,170 negotiating team .
e07-066-00,163 A Gardeners Chronicle reader living in
e07-066-01,161 Grantham , Lincs , kindly offered to
e07-066-02,160 cooperate with me in studying praying
e07-066-03,160 mantis as a pest control in the cold
e07-066-04,156 greenhouse . Of the dozen Spanish mantis
e07-066-05,152 sent him by post on June 22 , only two or
e07-066-06,156 three survived the journey ; one thrived
e07-066-07,155 and the latest report I have is that
e07-066-08,155 this mantis is still alive .
e01-022-00,151 Lucky indeed are the families that
e01-022-01,151 possess a heritage of lace . A lace
e01-022-02,151 bridal veil handed down from mother
e01-022-03,151 to daughters , a lace-trimmed Christening
e01-022-04,146 robe that each generation wears in turn -
e01-022-05,146 these are proud possessions , linked to the
e01-022-06,149 exquisite lace-making of the past .
f01-081-02,158 sciences . For example the success of the atomic theory
f01-081-03,157 in physics might lead us to suppose that the ultimate
b04-140-00,182 BEFORE the war he urged the British people
b04-140-01,182 to welcome Hitler's troops as tourists .
b04-140-02,182 After the war he favoured a preventive war against
b04-140-03,182 Russia . Now he wants Britain to demolish her
b04-140-04,182 defences . Throughout the years Lord Russell
b04-140-05,182 and his supporters have been able to pursue their
b04-140-06,182 eccentric campaigns in freedom . They should
b04-140-07,182 ask themselves this question : How long would
b04-140-08,182 that freedom last if their policies were adopted ?
a01-077u-01,169 Germany , Dr. Adenauer is in a tough spot .
a01-077u-02,171 Joyce Egginton cables : President Kennedy
a01-077u-03,172 at his Washington Press conference admitted
a01-077u-04,170 he did not know whether America was
a01-077u-05,170 lagging behind Russia in missile power .
a01-077u-06,171 He said he was waiting for his senior
a01-077u-07,172 military aides to come up with the answer
a01-077u-08,168 on February 20 .
b02-102-00,192 To Germany's Western allies the campaign has been a
b02-102-01,193 millstone weighing down and almost paralysing their
b02-102-02,192 efforts to work out sensible ways of dealing with
b02-102-03,193 the Berlin crisis . It need not have been such a burden
b02-102-04,188 if Western Governments had not been convinced
b02-102-05,185 that they must do nothing to harm even remotely Dr
b02-102-06,190 Adenauer's chances of being returned as Chancellor .
g05-098-00,181 So far had our thinking led us in this matter of the
g05-098-01,181 " Werewolves " that we had contemplated the necessity of very
g05-098-02,181 special precautions to guard the lives of our airmen . Particular
g05-098-03,182 hatred , we felt , was bound to be aimed at the representatives of
g05-098-04,179 those who had , over the years , spread such ghastly havoc , destruction
g05-098-05,179 and death over Germany , causing such wholesale slaughter among
g05-098-06,179 men , women and children , old and young alike .
c06-039-00,172 Among other incidents he was banned from New
c06-039-01,172 York's St. Patrick's Day parade as a " disorderly
c06-039-02,172 person . " He was in a fight after telling a
c06-039-03,172 Canadian , during a chat about space-flight :
c06-039-04,172 " Ireland will put a shillelagh into orbit , Israel
c06-039-05,172 will put a matzo ball into orbit , and Lichtenstein
c06-039-06,172 will put a postage stamp into orbit before you
c06-039-07,172 Canadians put up a mouse . "
r06-007-00,184 ' It is a pity , ' said Mart , ' because it would have been
r06-007-01,183 a good address . ' Now , after a woman's radar look ,
r06-007-02,181 she decided Pierre would solve our problems . This
r06-007-04,182 yellow as lemon peel , wrestling with some gnawing rat
r06-007-05,182 of an illness , man of all trades , married to a commanding
r06-007-06,180 lady who loved small talk and the discreet
r06-007-07,180 accumulation of money .
r02-038-00,175 ' It 's not mine . I wasn't sitting there . ' She blinked
r02-038-01,175 disdainfully at him and stepped out .
r02-038-02,175 It was a new briefcase , and as the train jogged along
r02-038-03,175 the shiny clasp twinkled invitingly at Cecil .
r02-038-04,175 He wondered what it contained . Probably the remains
r02-038-05,175 of someone's lunch or a few secret files .
a01-072x-00,184 These support costs are a big drain on America's
a01-072x-01,181 dollar reserves . Dr. Adenauer's answer is the
a01-072x-02,182 once-and-for-all cash offer of 357million . President
a01-072x-03,177 Kennedy's rejection of it is a painful blow to the

r03-002-00,191 In spite of all the transferred maternity
r03-002-01,191 she was endowed with by her patients ,
r03-002-04,182 infant-in-arms but a new-born babe , a
r03-002-05,191 premature piece of frailty in an oxygen-
r03-002-06,191 tent of utter innocence . The complexity of
r03-002-07,191 that innocence was colossal . It had layer
r03-002-08,191 after layer of illusion to be peeled off and
r03-002-09,191 replaced with sad knowledgeability .
r06-097-01,186 the turtle-doves drummed up the
r06-097-02,188 sun . The next morning , in the square
r06-097-03,186 opposite Pierre's , I read about the Nice
r06-097-04,184 beach catastrophe in the Patriote .
r06-097-05,186 Mart had been right , the body had been
r06-097-06,187 a woman's . It belonged to a Madame
r06-097-07,187 N. Enquiries had been made in the
r06-097-08,186 neighbourhood , and it transpired that
r06-097-09,187 Madame N's husband had made an
r06-097-10,186 arrangement with the dead lady's sister
c03-081a-00,180 Arguably , the dramatist has committed a
c03-081a-01,184 technical error in allowing Irene to speak
c03-081a-02,186 for herself ; we would be altogether clearer
c03-081a-03,184 in our minds about her if she remained
c03-081a-04,184 a flawed but beautiful enigma , seen but not
c03-081a-05,184 heard . However , Miss Pinkie Johnstone makes her
c03-081a-06,186 few brief scenes effective , and Mr. Dinsdale
c03-081a-07,186 Landen , in the longest and most exacting role ,
c03-081a-08,182 that of the sergeant , gives a performance of
c03-081a-09,182 rare intelligence and restrained power .
c03-007e-00,178 In A Taste of Honey Mr. Richardson has
c03-007e-01,178 taken a town in the industrial North of
c03-007e-02,179 England and has made it live . The shabby
c03-007e-03,177 streets and wet pavements , the school play-
c03-007e-04,176 grounds , the public monuments and the
c03-007e-05,173 rubbish strewn canals - even the worn
c03-007e-06,178 head-stones in the churchyard , " sacred to
c03-007e-07,177 the memory of " - are seen as an integral
c03-007e-08,171 part of the story .
r03-035-00,179 " Of course you must count about two hundred
r03-035-01,193 for legal charges and stamp duties ,
r03-035-02,200 maybe less , depending on the price of the
r03-035-03,200 house , and whether it has been regis-
r03-035-04,204 tered . I take it you have a mortgage lined
r03-035-05,202 up , then , Mrs. - er - Buttery ? " " Not yet ,

c02-017-00,192 Following Bruce Marshall's original novel with
c02-017-01,193 considerable fidelity , the film tells the story
c02-017-02,192 of a little monk who prays that a disrepu-
c02-017-03,188 table night club near his church be re-
c02-017-04,189 moved . One night his prayer is answered
c02-017-05,191 and the offending establishment is suddenly
c02-017-06,191 transplanted to an island in the North Sea .
c02-017-07,190 But Father Malachias's troubles have only
c02-017-08,192 begun . Instead of having the desired effect ,
c02-017-09,192 the miracle becomes exploited by a group
g06-026h-00,182 A pleasant life truly ! ... It so happens that I have
g06-026h-01,182 an Italian who is perhaps the best Valet de Chambre
g06-026h-02,182 that ever was . But he has not one word of English . '
g06-026h-04,182 of the Whigs , and the temporary assumption of
a02-042-01,164 on anyone convicted of sabotage . These stern measures
a02-042-02,163 had the desired effect today at Kumasi where the
a02-042-05,160 police and 16 armoured cars . And how did the
a02-042-06,159 Government react when the strikers demonstrated in
a02-042-07,158 Accra ?
g05-094-00,182 The Nazi fortress concept turned out to be nothing
g05-094-01,186 more than a fantasy . Thanks to the good
g05-094-02,182 sense of the front line soldiers , the
g05-094-03,182 meeting of East and West was marked by
g05-094-04,182 the use of no weapon more lethal than
g05-094-05,182 vodka . And the effect on the German people
g05-094-06,186 of the first ten years of the promised
g05-094-07,186 thousand of Nazi rule , so far from creating
g05-094-08,182 a spirit of warlike frenzy , had produced
g05-094-09,182 universally a dull bewildered apathy .
g06-050g-00,168 Mauro's first action was to write to his revered master
g06-050g-01,170 at Ko"then , near Leipzig , asking for advice . In doing so he
g06-050g-02,169 described his distinguished patient and his symptoms . He told
g06-050g-03,169 Hahnemann that he found Anglesey a strong , energetic man
g06-050g-04,170 with a gentle and charming character , even-tempered and
g06-050g-05,165 sedate , not easily irritated , patient and persevering , ' but he
g06-050g-06,168 appears to despair of ever being cured . '
r03-050-00,182 His aspect was as dusty as his office , with scurf
r03-050-01,182 from dusty hair on the dusty shoulders of his black
r03-050-02,182 suit , cigarette ash down the front , an ashen face
r03-050-03,182 and yellow sleepy dust in the corners of his pale
r03-050-04,182 grey eyes . His finger-nails were dirty , though he
r03-050-05,182 tried to make up for it by constantly paring them
r03-050-06,182 with the finger-nail of the opposite hand .
g06-045d-01,182 diplomatist Lord Ponsonby , had written to advise Anglesey
g06-045d-02,182 to give the system a trial , adding that it was being
g06-045d-03,182 cultivated with extraordinary success in France and Italy ,
g06-045d-04,182 and that he himself was being treated under a doctor
g06-045d-05,182 who had studied under its founder , the aged Dr. Samuel
g06-045d-06,162 Hahnemann .
g06-047d-00,182 This remarkable man of medicine , whom Sir Francis
g06-047d-01,182 Burdett described to Anglesey a year or two later as
g06-047d-02,182 ' more like a God upon earth than a human being ' ,
g06-047d-03,182 had an increasing number of disciples among unorthodox
g06-047d-04,182 medical men in the cities of Europe . One of these
g06-047d-05,182 was the Neapolitan , Dr Giuseppe Mauro , whom Anglesey
g06-047d-06,182 consulted in May 1834 .
r06-066-00,175 Then here was Nice , and the old holiday
r06-066-01,177 sea , blue as a new school exercise
r06-066-02,176 book . The same old Nice , creamy ,
r06-066-03,174 vulgar , out of time , bitter-sweet with
r06-066-04,175 the ghosts of dead monarchs and brilliant
r06-066-08,171 could catch the taste of dead dreams on

c03-094f-00,173 Mr. William Lucas ( Morris ) is always insensi-
c03-094f-01,173 tively pushing , Miss Sheila Allen his wife ,
c03-094f-02,171 always palely appealing , Mr. James Maxwell ,
c03-094f-03,170 the editor , always comically abashed by
c03-094f-05,172 father-in-law , always comically grotesque ;
c03-094f-06,173 they were not asked to modulate from
c03-094f-07,170 their set moods but played with proper
c03-094f-08,169 efficiency and , in the case of Mr. Richards ,
c03-094f-09,172 with lavish and suitably gaudy colour .
a06-110-00,176 Conservatives protested when
a06-110-01,178 Mr. Gaitskell said he had been
a06-110-02,176 told this " by some # people
a06-110-03,177 of considerable authority , " he
a06-110-04,176 retorted . " I agree with the Prime
a06-110-05,175 Minister that I do not think
a06-110-06,175 we are necessarily bound for

e02-100-00,176 Most tools have to lead an intensive life , and faults
e02-100-01,179 in design or quality soon become apparent . It is far
e02-100-02,177 better to pay the fair price for a tool of good
e02-100-04,174 To put it in a slightly different way , do not allow
e02-100-05,166 yourself to blame the tools when the job does
e02-100-06,162 not turn out quite right !
a05-108-00,185 This puzzled such students of comparative
a05-108-01,185 religion as had failed to detect this cult .
a05-108-02,185 But Mr. Healey had a partial and
a05-108-03,184 limited success . He rallied behind him
a05-108-05,182 night by his leader , Mr. Gaitskell . Mr.
a05-108-06,182 Godber's performance merited all the mild
a05-108-07,182 scorn heaped on it by Mr. Shinwell .

g06-011j-02,182 it as much as his health permitted him to
g06-011j-03,182 enjoy anything . ' The Pearl ' , he wrote , ' is arrived ,
g06-011j-04,182 which is a great resource . Vesuvius seems
g06-011j-06,182 a gay , lively people , and what a busy town .
g06-011j-07,182 At Rome , every other man was a priest :
g06-011j-08,182 here the priest is 1superceded by the
g06-011j-09,182 soldier - a favourable change in my eye ,
g06-011j-10,182 particularly as the troops are very fine . '
g06-018h-00,182 When the sailing season was past , he sent Pearl back to
g06-018h-01,182 England , and returned to Rome for the winter . In late
g06-018h-02,182 November , he was ' suffering as usual ' , but hoped , he
g06-018h-03,182 told Arthur , ' to find this place agree with me better

c02-059-01,181 Prizes being what they are , Berlin is unusually
c02-059-02,178 generous in giving everyone something , and silver
c02-059-03,176 bears are awarded in every direction . Both the
c02-059-04,172 Antonioni and Wicki films took high honours ,
c02-059-05,174 and the audience at the awards was particularly
c02-059-06,176 enthusiastic when one Miss Anna Kerima was selected
c02-059-07,172 as best actress for her work in the Godard
c02-059-08,172 film . Gifted with an interesting face , although little
c02-059-09,174 acting ability , she would seem to be well
c02-059-10,177 worth watching in the months to come .

a04-010-01,172 Admiralty House meeting will be made in the
a04-010-02,172 House of Commons this afternoon . Labour M.P.s already
a04-010-03,172 have many questions to the Prime Minister asking
a04-010-04,172 for a statement . President Kennedy flew from London
a04-010-05,172 Airport last night to arrive in Washington this

a04-010-07,172 broadcast and television report on his
a04-010-08,172 talks with Mr. Krushchov this evening .
f02-076-00,182 1 . Are there differences in adjustment to ageing
f02-076-01,182 and retirement according to the occupational
f02-076-02,182 level of employees ? 2 . If so , which occupational
f02-076-03,182 levels are the better or the poorer prepared
f02-076-04,162 for successful adjustment to retirement and
f02-076-05,182 in what aspects ? 3 . Does the evidence
f02-076-06,182 obtained support a rationale for adapting
f02-076-07,182 a pre-retirement planning and preparation
f02-076-08,162 programme to the needs of older employees
f02-076-09,162 of different occupational levels ?
b04-175-00,182 Certainly teenagers earn more than ever before .
b04-175-01,182 Certainly they spend more . But how splendid
b04-175-02,182 that in the most prosperous days in this
b04-175-03,182 country's history the old-fashioned virtue of thrift
b04-175-04,182 should still have a powerful appeal for young

b06-100-00,177 The heli-hopping Duke of Edinburgh ,
b06-100-01,173 opening a few technical college extensions ,
b06-100-02,176 will not keep us abreast of the
b06-100-03,175 scientific revolution . Out of the 550,000
b06-100-04,172 young people aged 15-17 starting
b06-100-06,173 went into unskilled work . The per-
b06-100-07,171 centage is expected to swell to 80
b06-100-08,171 next year . The Duke , possibly
b06-100-09,171 speaking from experience , stated :
b06-027-00,184 Last month West Germany was
b06-027-01,184 reported to be halfway toward
b06-027-05,181 Herr Strauss and his fellows
b06-027-08,180 Heusinger , the man who caused
b06-027-09,182 a great disturbance last autumn
r02-078-00,191 He climbed the stairs , eager to unload the
r02-078-02,191 to emerge carrying his shame unseen , but burning ,
r02-078-03,191 into the night . He reached the barrier and
r02-078-04,182 fumbled for his contract before thrusting the
r02-078-05,191 briefcase at the ticket-collector with the firm
r02-078-06,203 intention of playing the dutiful citizen
r02-078-07,191 retrieving lost property .
f04-024-00,187 The police began a systematic search of the line -
f04-024-01,183 no easy task , but one in which patience and method
f04-024-03,185 Putney and Wandsworth they found a bloodstained
f04-024-04,184 pestle such as chemists use , with some hairs
f04-024-05,186 sticking to it . The murder weapon , more than likely ,

a02-116-01,182 ended yesterday in 32 members of the
a02-116-02,191 Committee of 100 being imprisoned for inciting
a02-116-03,182 a breach of the peace . The committee's
a02-116-04,182 president 89-year-old Earl Russell and
a02-116-05,182 his 61-year-old wife were each jailed for
a02-116-08,182 jailed for a month .

r06-044-01,174 Monsieur H , for instance , had been clubbed and
r06-044-02,174 throttled to death by his wife , children and
r06-044-03,174 father-in-law , after muddling up some sheep
r06-044-04,176 while the worse for drink . The family
r06-044-05,174 group then sat down for a late lunch
r06-044-06,173 before the father-in-law telephoned the police .
r06-044-07,173 Then again , Monsieur V , owing to family
r06-044-08,173 troubles , had written to the local
r06-044-09,173 paper and the superintendent of police ,
r06-044-10,173 informing them that he was on the point
h04-021-00,150 As in 1958 , younger couples paid some 12 1/2 per cent
h04-021-01,150 more per calorie than the national average , and families
h04-021-02,150 with four or more children 19 per cent less . The only
h04-021-04,148 for whom the index declined from 91 to 88 . Table 27
h04-021-05,148 also shows the corresponding values of an index which
h04-021-06,149 compares the prices paid by different types of household
h04-021-07,149 for the commodities constituting the average household

a02-072-01,157 probably mean jail and , though frail , he is very fit and
a02-072-02,158 will take the rigours of prison in his stride . He
a02-072-03,153 hopes to be allowed to do some writing . " Back at
a02-072-04,151 the Press conference , Mr. Clark said two committee
a02-072-05,157 members tried a " plant " call on suspect phone . They
a02-072-06,157 discussed a sit-down at Watford at 5.30 p.m. - none
a02-072-07,154 was planned but police turned up .

b01-118-02,162 water in the white areas of South Africa , without rights
b01-118-03,162 and without hope . THE same sort of good neighbour
b01-118-04,162 that he proved to be to the Jews fleeing from
b01-118-05,162 Hitler in the thirties . It was Dr. Verwoerd who
b01-118-06,172 led a protest against admitting any of them

f01-147-01,165 can nevertheless identify it . Similarly the psychologist has
f01-147-02,167 to be prepared to observe and make inferences about
f01-147-03,165 all kinds of processes in other people , whether or not they
f01-147-04,163 correspond with anything in his own experience . We know
f01-147-05,163 very little about the patterns of brain-activity which
f01-147-06,167 provide our schemas , nor do we need to know as far as
f01-147-07,162 psychology is concerned - these patterns are the concern of
f01-147-08,159 the neuro-physiologists .
a05-048-00,175 Long before polling closed at 8 p.m. it was
a05-048-01,180 evident that voters were bored by the
a05-048-02,177 Government's frequent appeals to the electorate .
a05-048-03,177 The election was the fourth in four years .
a05-048-04,173 In most constituencies it may go down as
a05-048-05,175 the most apathetic in the country's history .
a05-048-06,173 THE Prime Minister disclosed in the Commons
a05-048-07,173 last night that he had considered early
a05-048-08,175 in the Parliamentary recess whether to
a05-048-09,173 mobilise reserves necessary to bring the
a05-048-10,170 British Army of the Rhine on to a war footing .
c03-084a-00,186 Mr. Bryan Stonehouse's production is quietly
c03-084a-01,185 effective , giving full value to the formal elements
c03-084a-02,187 of Betti's writing without over-emphasizing
c03-084a-03,183 them . Last night's play in the " Play of the
c03-084a-04,182 Week " series on independent television , Then
c03-084a-05,185 We Fall , by Mr. Paul Ferris , was a morality
c03-084a-06,186 on the not unfamiliar theme of the destructive
c03-084a-07,189 power of unbridled ambition .
c04-105-00,168 NEW boy on the vocal front is
c04-105-01,168 Rolly Daniels , who comes 5,000 miles
c04-105-02,167 from India to seek disc fame . Comedian Hal
c04-105-03,167 Monty saw him in Bombay , became his manager .
c04-105-04,167 And such is Hal's faith that he brings him to
c04-105-05,167 Europe . Now Rolly gets his big break - a
c04-105-06,166 record , the modern Aladdin's lamp of
c04-105-07,168 show business .
g01-000-00,163 A Scottish knight - Sir John Mercer - was
g01-000-01,162 imprisoned in England . His son , in revenge , was
g01-000-02,162 harrying English shipping as far away as Cherbourg ,
g01-000-03,161 and doing it to some purpose . John Philpot ,
g01-000-04,160 one of that new class of merchant financiers
g01-000-05,162 which the city of London was now producing , fitted ,
g01-000-06,163 equipped and manned a fleet from his own
g01-000-07,163 resources , and captured the young Mercer in a
g01-000-08,163 brilliant Channel fight .
g06-011i-00,162 By the end of the month he still delighted in Naples .
g06-011i-01,182 He told Cloncurry that he enjoyed it as much as his
g06-011i-02,162 health permitted him to enjoy anything . ' The Pearl ' , he
g06-011i-03,182 wrote , ' is arrived , which is a great resource . Vesuvius
g06-011i-05,162 lively people , and what a busy town . At Rome , every other
g06-011i-06,162 man was a priest : here the priest is 1superceded by
g06-011i-08,162 as the troops are very fine . '
p06-248-00,183 The thought of Nicholas haunted her , the sense of
p06-248-01,184 loss crucifying . Her father's comment roused her as
p06-248-02,183 he said , ' I was not talking of a carnival . But I
p06-248-03,183 presume we shall be allowed to have one or two
p06-248-04,183 of our friends at the ceremony . '
c03-094e-01,179 sitively pushing , Miss Sheila Allen his wife ,
c03-094e-02,180 always palely appealing , Mr. James Maxwell ,
c03-094e-03,180 the editor , always comically abashed by
c03-094e-06,180 they were not asked to modulate from
c03-094e-07,182 their set moods but played with proper
c03-094e-08,178 efficiency and , in the case of Mr. Richards ,
c03-094e-09,178 with lavish and suitably gaudy colour .
c03-087f-00,173 It went , perhaps , some distance beyond
c03-087f-01,172 most treatments of its subject by attempting
c03-087f-02,173 to generate a melodramatic inevitability
c03-087f-03,170 which left its central character and the
c03-087f-05,173 desolation . We could , perhaps , say whether
c03-087f-06,173 or not the attempt succeeded if we had a
c03-087f-07,171 little more faith in the way in which Mr.
c03-087f-08,169 Ferris manipulated his characters .
g06-018m-00,182 When the sailing season was past , he sent Pearl
g06-018m-01,182 back to England , and returned to Rome for the
g06-018m-02,182 winter . In late November , he was ' suffering as
g06-018m-03,182 usual ' , but hoped , he told Arthur , ' to find this
g06-018m-04,182 place agree with me better than Naples . The journey
g06-018m-05,182 has been against me , as there has been much
g06-018m-06,162 rain and damp , but the temperature is high
g06-018m-07,182 & I have not yet thought of a fire ... .
r02-054-00,191 It was locked . Eager fingers felt bulky contents and
r02-054-01,191 when he shook the case there was a rustling thud
r02-054-03,191 five thousand at least . ' He felt in his jacket pocket
r02-054-04,191 and pulled out a key ring . In succession he tried
r02-054-05,191 his own briefcase key , a suitcase key and a
r02-054-06,191 device designed to lock typewriters .
g04-017-00,172 It was while I was at Tatsfield that I first visited Oberammergau
g04-017-01,170 in Bavaria to witness the Passion Play . The place and its people were
g04-017-02,171 to play an important part in my life . For five years in succession till
g04-017-03,170 war broke out in 1914 , I spent my summer holidays there and became
g04-017-04,167 very intimate with the people and the environs . Every year between the
g04-017-05,169 Passion Plays , an interval of ten years , another play would be
g04-017-06,169 performed at the small theatre in the village , when new talent would
g04-017-07,170 be discovered and trained .
b04-000-00,182 A BAFFLED and bewildered little country
b04-000-01,172 stands at the centre of an international
b04-000-02,182 storm . Belgium is accused - without a
b04-000-03,182 scrap of evidence - of being implicated in
b04-000-04,172 the murder of Patrice Lumumba . Her
b04-000-05,172 leaders are insulted , her embassies are
b04-000-06,182 attacked in a score of countries .
b05-055-00,186 The village green is the real home of cricket . A couple of bumps
b05-055-01,186 on a pitch have no terrors for a good batsman with a stout
b05-055-02,186 heart , a firm grip on the willow and a hefty contempt for
b05-055-03,186 batting averages and all the statistical blight that makes a
b05-055-04,186 mighty six these days as rare as frostbite in summer .
g06-011l-00,182 By the end of the month he still delighted in Naples . He
g06-011l-01,186 told Cloncurry that he enjoyed it as much as his health
g06-011l-03,186 ' is arrived , which is a great resource . Vesuvius seems
g06-011l-05,182 people , and what a busy town . At Rome , every other
g06-011l-06,186 man was a priest : here the priest is 1superceded by the
g06-011l-08,182 the troops are very fine . '
c03-096a-00,186 Only Mr. Lucas's actions , therefore , arose
c03-096a-01,187 explicably from appreciable motives . The rest ,
c03-096a-02,185 one feels , were driven to effective action by
c03-096a-03,187 the author in spite of the ineffectuality
c03-096a-04,185 with which he had endowed them . One
c03-096a-05,185 hopes that he is not asking us to believe
c03-096a-06,184 that , because of their odd accents , they
c03-096a-07,186 act oddly like the queer foreigners of
c03-096a-08,180 tradition .
b02-035-00,170 On this reading what Mr. Gollancz calls
b02-035-01,172 manoeuvring , and what we should call
b02-035-03,174 a means not to destruction but to safety .
b02-035-04,173 The Government's pompous little statement
b02-035-05,174 on Northern Rhodesia does not say much ,
b02-035-06,181 but it says what is necessary - that
b02-035-07,181 the Northern Rhodesia Constitution is
b02-035-09,176 much the Government tries to disguise
b02-035-10,183 it by saying that the revision would be
b01-038-00,182 Certainly , the rise is very small . But it is a step
b01-038-02,189 will now grow brighter of further international
b01-038-03,189 co-operation , which is the only way to solve the
b01-038-04,182 payments difficulties that upset the Western world .
b01-038-05,182 Britain and the U.S. , which have problems with
b01-038-06,189 their balances , will gain some immediate help .
b01-038-07,189 What it means in practical terms is that our
b01-038-08,182 exports to Germany will now be a little cheaper
b01-038-09,182 for Germans to buy , while the goods which
b01-038-10,189 Germany exports will be made a little dearer .
c03-016b-01,154 realism in the situation . A young girl lives in
c03-016b-03,151 promiscuous mother . In such surroundings she
c03-016b-04,151 learns sex is something sordid , and when she
c03-016b-06,153 is incoherently , clumsily , but half shyly and
c03-016b-07,150 half inquisitively . As is the case in Fanny her
c03-016b-08,151 first lover is a sailor who leaves her to bear
c03-016b-09,153 his child and sails away .
b04-010-00,182 Who will speak for Belgium ? Who else but
b04-010-01,172 Britain . We have fought beside Belgium
b04-010-02,172 in two world wars . We are allies still .
b04-010-03,182 Britain should champion Belgium . Not
b04-010-04,172 with the careful , hooded language of diplomacy ,
b04-010-05,172 but boldly and fearlessly . It is time to
b04-010-06,172 show the world that this country does not
b04-010-07,172 desert her friends . HAPPY , happy
b04-010-08,172 families ! Never before have Britain's
b04-010-09,172 larders been so well stocked .
a01-063-00,152 But he said discussions " on a higher
a01-063-02,152 useful . The President will probably
a01-063-03,152 discuss the problem with Dr. Brentano ,
a01-063-04,152 the West German Foreign Minister , who is
a01-063-05,152 due in Washington next week . A big
a01-063-07,152 payment of a 210million debt to America .
a01-063-08,152 United States officials quickly point out
a01-063-09,152 that this is money due to America
a01-063-10,152 anyway .
a03-071-00,164 But , at the same time , there is reason to
a03-071-01,165 believe that the Federal Government is not
a03-071-02,166 convinced , on the basis of the information
a03-071-03,164 it has so far , that such a project would
a03-071-05,165 and not merely constitute a " prestige "
a03-071-06,165 satellite , duplicating to some extent American
a03-071-07,167 efforts , as Die Welt suggests today in
g06-045g-00,182 In April of that year his first wife's brother-in-law , the
g06-045g-01,182 diplomatist Lord Ponsonby , had written to advise Anglesey
g06-045g-02,182 to give the system a trial , adding that it was being cultivated
g06-045g-03,182 with extraordinary success in France and Italy , and that he
g06-045g-04,182 himself was being treated under a doctor who had studied
g06-045g-05,162 under its founder , the aged Dr. Samuel Hahnemann .
a02-004-00,185 So the idea of personal mission by
a02-004-01,183 the Prime Minister to Paris was dropped
a02-004-02,182 Instead Mr. Macmillan will rely on a
a02-004-03,177 hand-picked team under the leadership of
a02-004-05,180 France , to back Mr. Edward Heath , Lord
a02-004-06,179 Privy Seal , who is charged with the conduct
a02-004-07,175 of negotiations with the Six . At the same
a02-004-08,173 time the Prime Minister has offered
a02-004-10,179 safeguard their interests
g04-003-01,182 a walk over the fields while we attended
g04-003-02,183 to our business . To my amusement ,
g04-003-03,184 when we met at tea at the rectory
g04-003-04,182 after the Dedication , the Archbishop
g04-003-05,178 said he had been stopped by
g04-003-06,182 a farmer in a field . He seemed
g04-003-07,181 rather indignant , but we took the
g04-003-08,177 episode without a smile till afterwards .
c03-016a-00,187 But there is heart in the telling , and an
c03-016a-01,186 intense realism in the situation . A young
c03-016a-02,185 girl lives in a single dingy room with
c03-016a-03,184 her slatternly , promiscuous mother . In such
c03-016a-04,183 surroundings she learns sex is something
c03-016a-05,185 sordid , and when she experiences it for the
c03-016a-06,186 first time herself it is incoherently , clumsily ,
c03-016a-07,183 but half inquisitively . As is the case in Fanny
c03-016a-08,182 her first lover is a sailor who leaves her
c03-016a-09,183 to bear his child and sails away .
b04-116-00,162 And as the British Government stepped up the pace
b04-116-01,162 of change , so the Africans stepped up their demands .
b04-116-02,162 TODAY , in London , that rash and thoughtless policy has
b04-116-03,162 caused a crisis - a crisis that never should have happened .
b04-116-04,162 No wonder there is doubt and fearful heart-searching .
b04-116-05,162 If the Government now reverses its plan to give the
b04-116-06,162 Africans control in Northern Rhodesia it may indeed face
b04-116-07,162 difficulties from African politicians greedy for power .
a06-090-00,191 He claimed that , unless we were in the
a06-090-01,191 Common Market , we should not be able to
a06-090-02,191 play any part in # determining its future .
a06-090-03,194 " We can lead better from within , " he said .
a06-090-04,194 Mr. Macmillan dealt with the main objection
a06-090-05,194 raised by Tory critics . Mr. Anthony Fell ,
a06-090-06,194 who created a scene on this point on
a06-090-07,194 Monday , took up a position almost hidden
a06-090-08,194 behind the Serjeant at Arms' chair .
c03-081b-00,154 Arguably , the dramatist has committed a
c03-081b-01,155 technical error in allowing Irene to speak for
c03-081b-02,154 herself ; we would be altogether clearer in our
c03-081b-03,153 minds about her if she remained a flawed but
c03-081b-04,150 beautiful enigma , seen but not heard . However ,
c03-081b-05,152 Miss Pinkie Johnstone makes her few brief scenes
c03-081b-07,153 the longest and most exacting role , that of the
c03-081b-08,149 sergeant , gives a performance of rare intelligence
c03-081b-09,149 and restrained power .
b05-079-00,172 This concept of slavery included Britain .
b05-079-01,172 General Brauchitsch signed a directive
b05-079-02,172 ordering that after the successful
b05-079-03,172 invasion of our islands all the " able-bodied
b05-079-04,172 male population between the ages of
b05-079-05,172 seventeen and forty-five will , unless the
b05-079-06,172 local situation calls for an exceptional
b05-079-07,172 ruling , be interned and dispatched to the
b05-079-08,172 Continent . " The Baltic States were
b05-079-09,172 to have been our destination .
a01-011x-08,161 Macleod , is insisting on a policy of change .
a01-014x-00,197 Sir Roy's United Federal Party is boycotting
a01-014x-01,193 the London talks on the Protectorate's
a01-014x-02,196 future . Said Mr. Nkumbula last night :
a01-014x-03,189 " We want to discuss what to do if the
a01-014x-04,187 British Government gives in to Sir Roy
a01-014x-05,193 and the talks fall through . There are bound
a01-014x-06,194 to be demonstrations . " Yesterday Sir Roy's
a01-014x-07,188 chief aide , Mr. Julius Greenfield , telephoned
a01-014x-08,184 his chief a report on his talks with Mr.
a01-014x-09,190 Macmillan at Chequers .
a01-117-01,175 needy than Labour had to make it in 1950 . And
a01-117-02,175 as a percentage of social service expenditure ,
a01-117-03,175 health had fallen from 28.5 to 23.1 per cent.
a01-117-04,175 Then Mr. Brown swung his attack directly to the
a01-117-05,160 unsmiling Mr. Powell . He demanded that instead
a01-117-06,162 of taking it out of the patients Mr. Powell should
a01-117-07,175 take ruthless action against the drug making
a01-117-08,160 industry , whose profits had risen by up to 400
a01-117-09,162 per cent. in the last eight years .
a05-073-00,176 He spent most of his short half-hour on
a05-073-01,176 Berlin . He deplored the possibility of
a05-073-02,178 some " new myth " about betrayal of Germany
a05-073-04,176 know what the Russians want . " But he was
a05-073-05,174 certain that they wanted to establish a
a05-073-06,177 final and irrevocable division of Germany .
a05-073-07,175 Britain could not be a party to an imposed
a05-073-08,175 division . But negotiation , as the debate had
a05-073-09,176 shown , could be undertaken on a variety
a03-006-00,176 Today , for example , the Foreign Minister of Indo-
a03-006-01,176 nesia arrived in Belgrade as the guest of the Yugoslav
a03-006-02,176 Foreign Minister . In fact such Yugoslav activity has
a03-006-03,176 been # particularly intensified in the past year
a03-006-04,176 or so and though so far , apart from joint action
a03-006-05,176 in the United Nations , these exchanges have not
a03-006-06,176 been seen on any wider basis , President Tito
a03-006-07,176 is known for some time to have favoured a
a03-006-08,176 conference of neutralist leaders .
p06-242-00,183 Philip bristled . ' It was never our intention
p06-242-01,184 to have one of those carnival affairs , ' he
p06-242-02,180 retorted and in that second , he became the man of
p06-242-03,181 success exerting authority . Sandra watched her father's
p06-242-04,182 face pale . Philip , she knew , got on his nerves , but
p06-242-05,181 everything had gone over her head . It didn't really
p06-242-06,180 matter what was being said because she was
p06-242-07,180 no longer a part of it .
g06-042i-00,162 Nor is this to be wondered at , for even today , in the
g06-042i-01,162 1960s , no cure has been found for the 6tic douloureux . As
g06-042i-02,162 early as 1830 , when Anglesey believed himself to be on
g06-042i-03,162 the point of death , the new German curative method known
g06-042i-04,162 as homoeopathy had been brought to his notice .

f01-053-05,160 how to do this for himself , with the help
f01-053-06,162 of books . He uses his vocabulary to

g06-026b-02,182 the best Valet de Chambre that
g06-026b-03,182 ever was . But he has not one word
g06-026b-04,182 of English . ' While he was writing
g06-026b-05,182 this letter he heard of the fall of
g06-026b-06,162 the Whigs , and the temporary
g06-026b-07,162 assumption of the government by
g06-026b-08,162 the Duke of Wellington .
a06-004-00,184 Sir Edward Boyle , Financial Secretary
a06-004-01,187 to the Treasury , said yesterday that the
a06-004-02,185 Government does not like retrospective legislation .
a06-004-03,187 He went on to describe the kind of
a06-004-04,186 people the Chancellor hopes to tax . These
a06-004-05,183 are people buying and selling shares within
a06-004-06,183 a short period , those " stagging " on a new issue
a06-004-07,185 and property dealers who form a chain of
a06-004-08,183 companies and put one property deal through
a06-004-09,179 each .
b04-134-00,182 For expansion today means still greater
b04-134-01,182 prosperity tomorrow . BERTRAND RUSSELL ,
b04-134-02,182 the 88-year-old standard bearer of the Ban-
b04-134-03,182 the-Bomb crusade , has devoted following .
b04-134-04,182 Thousands march with him - and sit with him
b04-134-05,182 too . It is said by some that he is a saint ; by
b04-134-06,182 others that he is a prophet . He is , in fact , a
b04-134-07,182 philosopher with a highly developed sense of publicity
b04-134-08,182 who has been spectacularly wrong on the great
b04-134-09,182 issues of our time .
b01-000-00,190 Prime Minister after Prime Minister speaks out
b01-000-01,190 in revulsion against the South African
b01-000-02,190 Government's policy of apartheid as we wait
b01-000-03,190 for the curtain to rise on the Commonwealth
b01-000-04,190 Conference in London . Will it end with
b01-000-05,182 South Africa's exclusion from the
b01-000-06,190 Commonwealth ? The issue is touch and go .
a03-040-00,161 All four were Conservative strongholds . Last September
a03-040-01,161 a public poll showed that for the first time since
a03-040-02,161 the Administration came to power in 1957 the
a03-040-03,161 Liberals were ahead ( 43 per cent were in favour
a03-040-04,161 of " The Grits " if a federal election had been
a03-040-05,161 held last autumn , 38 per cent for the
a03-040-06,161 Conservatives and 12 per cent for the C.C.F. ) .
a04-066-00,203 Mr Gaitskell added that agreement with the
a04-066-01,203 unilateralists was not possible , though
a04-066-02,203 he respected their views . He saw by reports
a04-066-04,203 recommending the supporters of unilateral nuclear
a04-066-05,203 disarmament to shift the emphasis of
a04-066-06,203 their intervention away from straight opposition
a04-066-08,203 to the Polaris base .
a02-120-00,182 The possibility that the Government might
a02-120-02,182 declare the whole rally illegal - whether
a02-120-03,182 the demonstrators sit down or not - was
a02-120-04,182 being discussed in Whitehall last night .
a02-120-05,182 It was last used a year ago , to deal
a02-120-06,182 with the St. Pancras rent riots . Today
a02-120-07,182 Mr. Butler will have talks with Police
a02-120-08,182 Commissioner Sir Joseph Simpson to

c03-094d-08,159 but played with proper efficiency and ,
c03-094d-09,159 in the case of Mr. Richards , with lavish
c03-094d-10,162 and suitably gaudy colour .
e02-018-00,161 A glance at the gauge marks at the bottom
e02-018-01,160 end reveals when the required amount
e02-018-02,159 has been removed , and if care is taken
e02-018-03,160 to stop the plane short of the squared
e02-018-04,157 pencil line at the top , the work will be
e02-018-05,156 accurate . The straight-edge can be used
e02-018-06,160 to test the straightness of the sides .
g06-047e-00,162 This remarkable man of medicine , whom Sir Francis Burdett
g06-047e-01,162 described to Anglesey a year or two later as ' more like a God
g06-047e-02,162 upon earth than a human being ' , had an increasing number
g06-047e-03,162 of disciples among unorthodox medical men in the cities of
g06-047e-04,162 Europe . One of these was the Neapolitan , Dr Giuseppe Mauro ,
g06-047e-05,162 whom Anglesey consulted in May 1834 .
a05-113-00,184 True , he did tell the House that the
a05-113-01,186 Government had asked the Medical Research
a05-113-02,186 Council to reassess the fall-out position in
a05-113-04,184 the council's findings would be published .
a05-113-05,182 He was not so happy in his defence of
a05-113-06,185 the Government's failure to condemn
a05-113-07,184 France for her nuclear tests in the
a05-113-08,185 Sahara on the grounds that they were
a05-113-09,184 only little ones .

r02-089-09,176 for the labels from half a hundredweight of

g06-042g-00,182 Nor is this to be wondered at , for even today , in the 1960s ,
g06-042g-01,182 no cure has been found for the 6tic douloureux . As
g06-042g-02,182 early as 1830 , when Anglesey believed himself to be on the
g06-042g-03,182 point of death , the new German curative method known as
g06-042g-04,182 homoeopathy had been brought to his notice .
a01-003u-00,159 Though they may gather some Left-wing
a01-003u-01,161 support , a large majority of Labour
a01-003u-02,161 M Ps are likely to turn down the Foot-
a01-003u-04,161 be that as Labour M Ps opposed the
a01-003u-05,163 Government Bill which brought life peers
a01-003u-06,163 into existence , they should not now put
a01-003u-07,165 forward nominees . He believes that the
a01-003u-08,164 House of Lords should be abolished and

c03-007d-00,152 In A Taste of Honey Mr. Richardson has
c03-007d-01,152 taken a town in the industrial North of
c03-007d-02,155 England and has made it live . The shabby
c03-007d-03,153 streets and wet pavements , the school
c03-007d-04,152 play-grounds , the public monuments and
c03-007d-05,152 the rubbish strewn canals - even the
c03-007d-06,155 worn head-stones in the churchyard , " sacred
c03-007d-07,160 to the memory of " - are seen as an
c03-007d-08,153 integral part of the story .
b06-000-00,172 SOME 17 years ago , in the early summer of 1934 ,
b06-000-01,172 the German ambassador in London was dictating
b06-000-02,172 a secret report to his chief von Papen , in Berlin .
b06-000-03,172 " Britain is uncomfortable in her role of champion
b06-000-04,172 of German rearmament , in opposition , to France . "
b06-000-05,172 Later that year he warned that Britain knew
b06-000-06,172 Germany was breaking the agreement to stop
b06-000-07,172 building bombers , and added :
b01-044-00,197 Booming Germany is deliberately encouraging more imports
b01-044-01,197 as a means to curb rising prices at home . She is
b01-044-02,196 also aware how # unpopular she has been growing
b01-044-03,197 by failing until now to co-operate as a creditor nation
b01-044-04,194 should . Germany exports much more than she imports .
b01-044-05,194 For upwards of five years the world's reserves of
b01-044-06,197 dollars have been drained into Germany .
c02-022-00,184 Soon a carnival springs up on the sight of
c02-022-01,185 the missing building . The Church rebukes the
c02-022-02,185 poor monk for his miracle , and as a
c02-022-03,183 crowning indignity the night club is
c02-022-04,183 given a gala society reopening on the
c02-022-05,180 island . Father Malachias goes to the island ,
c02-022-06,185 prays , and in a second miracle the
c02-022-07,186 night club is replaced in its original
c02-022-08,182 setting .
r03-065-00,199 That 's rather the point , isn't it ? " " No , but I mean - "
r03-065-03,224 to revise your ideas about - er - the type of
r03-065-04,224 property you intend to purchase . " She revised
r03-065-05,199 them . The little man from the Inter-Insular
r03-065-06,224 ( British Archipelago ) Insurance Company soon
r03-065-07,224 saw to that .
a02-093-00,164 JOHN DICKIE writes : Mr. Macmillan gave top
a02-093-01,163 priority to the clash over Northern Rhodesia on his
a02-093-02,162 return from Scotland yesterday . He summoned Mr.
a02-093-03,162 Iain Macleod , Colonial Secretary , and Mr. Duncan Sandys ,
a02-093-04,161 Commonwealth Relations Secretary for an hour's talks
a02-093-05,158 at Admiralty House . A statement is expected today
a02-093-06,160 to hold the door open for modifications to the
a02-093-07,160 new Constitution provided law and order is maintained
a04-072-01,190 Union would be prepared to reach
a04-072-02,191 an agreement on a zone of controlled
a04-072-03,190 disarmament in Europe . Mr Gaitskell
a04-072-04,189 concluded , declaring that the present
a04-072-05,189 was the beginning of a great period of
a04-072-06,188 opportunity for the party . It was a
a04-072-07,188 great chance that should be grasped .
a04-072-08,203 Inter-union jealousies prevent the
a04-072-09,203 fulfilment of a common policy for wages
a04-072-10,203 and other major questions , Mr. Jack Cooper
e01-113-00,168 1 . Grasp thread near end between thumb
e01-113-01,168 and forefinger . 2 . Make a loop by
e01-113-02,168 lapping long thread over short thread .
e01-113-03,168 3 . Hold loop in place between thumb
e01-113-04,169 and forefinger ( Fig. 1 ) . 1 . Take hold
e01-113-05,163 of broad bar of hook as you would a
e01-113-06,164 pencil . Bring middle finger forward to
e01-113-07,166 rest near tip of hook .
b04-154-00,172 GOOD for Sir Roy Welensky ! The tough ,
b04-154-01,182 resolute Premier of the Rhodesian Federation
b04-154-02,182 shakes the life out of his critics . He calls them
b04-154-03,182 " jelly-boned . " He promises to preserve federation
b04-154-04,182 against African fanatics and woolly minded
b04-154-05,182 individuals in the West . Some may ask : Is
b04-154-06,182 Welensky justified in being so harsh to those who
b04-154-07,182 disagree with him ? The facts answer that .
f02-000-00,192 The numerically largest group , consisting of male
f02-000-02,195 and in the works only , excluding the offices , was
f02-000-03,192 therefore selected . A detailed age-structure was
f02-000-04,186 compiled from personnel department records ,
f02-000-06,191 teen men seventy years of age or older ,
f02-000-08,186 five just fifty years of age .
a06-057-00,157 This seemed to infuriate Mr. Fell even more . " I cannot be told
a06-057-01,153 to sit down by the Prime Minister . " Protests had been expected
a06-057-02,157 from Tory rebels . But Mr. Fell's attack was unprecedented . He
a06-057-03,157 accused the Prime Minister of " political double talk . " " It had
a06-057-04,153 the effect on one former supporter that he now thinks this Prime
a06-057-05,157 Minister is a national disaster , " he said .
e04-019-00,174 The amount of the backward tilt and
e04-019-01,173 also the height is left to personal choice
e04-019-02,174 and the width is best taken directly
e04-019-03,175 from the work to ensure a good fit .
e04-019-04,171 Fix the piece A to the sides first
e04-019-05,172 with glue and panel pins and then fit
e04-019-07,171 B temporarily in place on the chair
e04-019-08,171 frame .
b05-058-00,186 They 'll be clapping the man who plays a straight theodolite next .
b05-058-01,182 EICHMANN continues # to reveal the extraordinary divisions of the
b05-058-02,186 German mind . Not content with arguing that he was only an
b05-058-03,186 efficient cog in the machine , he now claims that part of the
b05-058-04,186 endless massacre that led to the death of six million Jews was
f03-169-00,161 Each time you rehearse you will probably put
f03-169-01,161 things in a different way . All the better ! - it will
f03-169-02,161 sound much more spontaneous on the occasion
f03-169-03,161 itself . Remember your four names - have the list
f03-169-04,161 with you if you like - and you simply can't
f03-169-05,161 be flummoxed ! Of course , in any speech a good
f03-169-06,161 start and a good finish are half the battle .
b03-087-00,152 The notification he envisages must be given at least two days before the
b03-087-01,152 agreement is signed . To this there will be some opposition . The Bill is
b03-087-02,152 short and modest in scope , and it is doubtful whether the other Private
b03-087-03,152 Members' Bills in the offing will fill all the gaps . This fact may give
b03-087-04,139 the Government an extra excuse for counselling patience until the
b03-087-05,139 next report from the Molony committee .
a05-084-00,182 The Russians now realised its seriousness . The
a05-084-01,184 French doubts were more about procedure
a05-084-02,184 than about substance . The Prime Minister's
a05-084-03,182 attitude of studied calm brought down the
a05-084-04,184 temperature of the debate , which never
a05-084-05,179 at any time rose to fever pitch , to a
a05-084-06,181 remarkable degree of sub-normality .
a05-084-07,180 Throughout Mr. Macmillan's speech the Earl
a05-084-08,179 of Home , Foreign Secretary , was listening
a05-084-09,178 in the Peers' Gallery .
a06-025-00,176 The other TUC demands : Five leading
a06-025-01,176 Communists must not hold office for five
a06-025-02,176 years ; Sub-committees set up to strip
a06-025-03,176 secretary John Byrne of his powers must
a06-025-04,176 disband in ten days . These the ETU
a06-025-05,176 executive rejected as " wholly unacceptable "
a06-025-06,172 and " unwarranted " interference . " But it
a06-025-07,172 agreed to postpone operation of the sub-
a06-025-08,169 committees .
a06-119-00,182 Note circulation soared for the
a06-119-01,182 sixth successive week - this
a06-119-02,182 time by more than 15,000,000 # last
a06-119-03,182 week . And that brought the figure
a06-119-04,182 to a record 2,415,000,000 . This was
a06-119-05,182 100,000,000 more than the corresponding
a06-119-06,182 week last year and 37,000,000 up on
a06-119-07,182 the 1960 record set last Christmas .
a06-119-08,182 Now look at the other side of all
r02-146-02,191 upstairs with it . ' And I 've NOT been
r02-146-03,191 extravagant . ' " Naughty ! ' she called
c03-084d-00,153 Mr. Bryan Stonehouse's production is quietly
c03-084d-01,157 effective , giving full value to the formal
c03-084d-02,155 elements of Betti's writing without over-
c03-084d-03,156 emphasizing them . Last night's play in the
c03-084d-04,153 " Play of the Week " series on independent
c03-084d-05,155 television , Then We Fall , by Mr. Paul Fer-
c03-084d-06,155 ris , was a morality on the not unfamiliar
c03-084d-07,157 theme of the destructive power of unbridled
c03-084d-08,149 ambition .
g06-050k-00,156 Mauro's first action was to write to his revered
g06-050k-01,156 master at Ko"then , near Leipzig , asking
g06-050k-02,156 for advice . In doing so he described his
g06-050k-03,155 distinguished patient and his symptoms . He
g06-050k-04,155 told Hahnemann that he found Anglesey a
g06-050k-05,154 strong , energetic man with a gentle and
g06-050k-06,154 charming character , even-tempered and sedate ,
g06-050k-07,156 not easily irritated , patient and persevering ,
g06-050k-08,156 ' but he appears to despair of ever being cured . '
r06-041-00,176 There was a front-page rear-attack on de
r06-041-03,174 proposal to drop radio-active material into
r06-041-04,173 the Mediterranean between Corsica and St
r06-041-05,173 Raphael . All the murders were well documented
r06-041-06,175 and had the air of being written by an
r06-041-07,174 ingenious , but mad film director of the
r06-041-08,171 Thirties .
e04-004-00,157 Start by making the two side frames from 1 in. by 1 1/4 in. planed
e04-004-01,157 timber as shown in Fig. 1 . Although the timber will have already
e04-004-02,157 been machine planed , remember to go over each piece with
e04-004-03,159 a smoothing plane , otherwise the marks left by the cutters
e04-004-04,156 will show up after painting . The dimensions given enable the
e04-004-05,157 feeding tray to slide over a 30 in. table , but the height
e04-004-06,156 can be altered if required .
a03-011-00,175 But he now feels , in view of a changed international
a03-011-01,175 situation and especially in view of fresh problems facing
a03-011-02,175 the new and independent countries of Africa , that the
a03-011-03,175 time is ripe to have more frequent consultations between
a03-011-04,175 the uncommitted countries and even to work out common
a03-011-05,175 stands on various problems facing those nations . Two
a03-011-06,175 subjects , the Congo and Algeria , are the main topics
a03-011-07,175 of the talks in Belgrade - and on both the two
a03-011-08,162 leaders have identical ideas .
e07-098-00,153 Seed is sown , or seedlings are pricked out into them
e07-098-01,152 in the normal way , the only real difference
e07-098-02,153 being that more of the watering is done through a
e07-098-03,152 rose to avoid breaking the blocks with a spout
e07-098-04,151 of water . First-class plants of tomatoes ,
e07-098-05,146 cucumbers , marrows , melons , cauliflowers ,
e07-098-06,150 celery and onions , may all be raised in soil
e07-098-07,152 blocks ; so can such flowering plants as
e07-098-08,149 dahlias , chrysanthemums , salvias , sweet peas ,
e07-098-09,149 lupins and numerous others .

a01-030-02,176 M Ps yesterday : " I have no knowledge of secret negotiations . "
a01-030-03,176 He said Britain had an obligation to consult the Federal
a01-030-04,176 Government . But the final decision remained with the British

a01-030-07,182 refusing to sit round the conference table .
f02-017-00,159 The Rubery , Owen scheme is now in its
f02-017-01,174 fourth year , and opportunity has been taken
f02-017-02,174 to revise the course in the light of
f02-017-03,162 experience . Topics for the six weekly meetings
f02-017-04,162 of one-and-a-half hours ( each held half in
f02-017-05,159 company time , half in the man's time ) are
f02-017-06,159 now as follows : 1 . Personal adjustment 2 . Health
f02-017-07,174 3 . Work and leisure 4 . Living arrangements
f02-017-08,159 5 . Financial planning 6 . Final discussion
a03-017-00,190 Prince Souvanna Phouma has not yet replied to
a03-017-01,190 the mission , but recent statements made by him
a03-017-02,190 in Phnom Penh indicate that he still regards
a03-017-03,190 himself as the only legal Prime Minister of
a03-017-04,190 Laos . His policy of strict neutrality from 1951
a03-017-05,182 to 1958 kept the kingdom in peace , though
a03-017-06,190 at the cost of virtual partition of the country
a03-017-07,190 into the pro-communist north and the
a03-017-08,182 pro-western centre and south .
a01-007u-00,165 Since 1958 , 13 Labour life Peers and
a01-007u-01,166 Peeresses have been created . Most Labour
a01-007u-02,167 sentiment would still favour the abolition
a01-007u-03,168 of the House of Lords , but while it remains
a01-007u-04,166 Labour has to have an adequate number
a01-007u-05,166 of members . THE two rival African
a01-007u-06,166 Nationalist Parties of Northern Rhodesia
a01-007u-07,168 have agreed to get together to face
a01-007u-08,167 the challenge from Sir Roy Welensky ,
a01-007u-09,169 the Federal Premier .
e02-021-00,193 Incidentally , it is better to
e02-021-05,191 the outer surfaces being vertical as
e02-021-06,194 at ( B ) , Fig. 1 . To make a leg such as
f01-135-00,162 It is the tendency to get things
f01-135-01,160 the wrong way round . As a
f01-135-02,160 psychologist I am constantly
f01-135-03,160 encountering this tendency
f01-135-04,159 in friends and acquaintances .
f01-135-05,159 They think there is something
f01-135-06,158 inevitably " queer " about psychology
f01-135-07,159 and this feeling of queerness
f01-135-08,157 usually boils down to a quite
f01-135-09,158 mistaken belief that the
f01-135-10,159 psychologist first looks into ...
a02-050-01,203 the President back from his travels it might have been
a02-050-02,203 thought that the muster from the 13 States of the
a02-050-03,189 Commonwealth was an occasion worthy of his presence .
a02-050-04,189 After all it was Mr. Nkrumah who suggested that this
a02-050-05,189 year the Economic Consultative Council should meet
a02-050-06,189 in Accra .
a02-050-07,182 * enough
a06-100-00,182 Referring to previous negotiations , Mr. Macmillan looked towards
a06-100-02,182 President of the Board of Trade played a conspicuous part , " the
a06-100-03,182 Premier said . He dismissed the idea that Britain would be
a06-100-04,182 swamped by cheap labour . Our industry , he said , would
a06-100-05,182 probably gain . " Many people feel we have had , perhaps , too
a06-100-06,182 much shelter , " he went on .
g06-042j-00,182 Nor is this to be wondered at , for even today ,
g06-042j-01,182 in the 1960s , no cure has been found for
g06-042j-03,182 Anglesey believed himself to be on the
g06-042j-04,182 point of death , the new German curative
g06-042j-05,182 method known as homoeopathy had been
g06-042j-06,182 brought to his notice .
b04-081-00,188 Why not follow Lord Russell's lead today ?
b04-081-02,188 a foolish cause , but in a glorious one . Good health !
b04-081-05,186 in an extra two or three evenings . And they never
b04-081-06,186 go on strike .
r02-000-00,191 He had long sensed injustice in the distinctions
r02-000-01,191 drawn between ordinary wage-earners and those
r02-000-02,191 self-employed . By the time his monthly salary
r02-000-03,191 arrived , the Inland Revenue had already taken
r02-000-04,191 their share , and there were precious few
r02-000-05,182 reductions in tax save for wives , children ,
r02-000-06,191 life-insurances or any of the other normal

b03-109-00,191 Can it be shown that the one scale is demon-
b03-109-04,191 Even then it might be easier to persuade the British
b03-109-05,191 public to go over to decimal coinage - in certain
b03-109-06,191 circumstances the time would come when this would

g04-011-00,167 Meanwhile I had been asked to do a bit of Diocesan
g04-011-01,168 work in connection with Higher Religious Education , and
g04-011-02,168 to become the Southwark Secretary of the Church Reading
g04-011-03,166 Union . This meant organizing lectures and courses of
g04-011-04,165 religious instruction through the Diocese , and I
g04-011-05,166 also found myself a member of the Diocesan
g04-011-06,166 Conference , where I remember introducing myself as
g04-011-07,164 the incumbent of the highest church in the
g04-011-08,164 Diocese .
a05-099-00,187 A reference to the reunification of Germany
a05-099-01,188 brought a bark of " Start another war ! "
a05-099-02,185 from Mr. Ellis Smith ( Lab. , Stoke on Trent S. ) .
a05-099-03,187 Then Mr. Healey launched out on his pet
a05-099-04,187 theme of limitation of armaments in Europe .
a05-099-05,183 This could , he suggested , be linked with
a05-099-06,183 prohibition of the production of atomic
a05-099-07,182 weapons in any part of Europe . Inspection
a05-099-08,183 and control would be much easier to
c03-016c-00,188 But there is heart in the telling , and an
c03-016c-01,187 intense realism in the situation . A young
c03-016c-02,187 girl lives in a single dingy room with her
c03-016c-04,184 surroundings she learns sex is something sordid ,
c03-016c-06,187 herself it is incoherently , clumsily , but half

c03-016c-09,188 her to bear his child and sails away .
f01-085-00,157 There have been many conflicting tendencies in
f01-085-01,156 psychology in its search for ultimate units and here

g06-050d-00,182 Mauro's first action was to write to his revered
g06-050d-01,182 master at Ko"then , near Leipzig , asking for advice .
g06-050d-02,182 In doing so he described his distinguished patient
g06-050d-03,182 and his symptoms . He told Hahnemann that he found
g06-050d-04,182 Anglesey a strong , energetic man with a gentle and
g06-050d-05,182 charming character , even-tempered and sedate , not

a06-008-02,183 legislation . " Why don't you make proposals to legislate
a06-008-04,182 it an Autumn Budget . You can call it a Taxation
a06-008-05,182 Management Bill , if you like . " While Mr. Wilson

b01-033-01,182 their visit . The warmth of their welcome in India and

b01-033-03,189 yesterday by the Dutch - has made the gesture

a04-027-00,172 From Nato headquarters Mr. Rusk went to see President de Gaulle

a04-027-02,172 in London in time to join the Buckingham Palace dinner and to
a04-027-03,172 fly home with the President . In DUESSELDORF , Chancellor Adenauer
a04-027-04,172 said the Vienna talks " might be the beginning of a slight improvement , "

b02-045-00,181 Formula One , which appeared in February , appeared to make
b02-045-01,174 this likely ; Formula Two , which appeared in June , made it
b02-045-02,173 very unlikely ; if Formula Three restores the original
b02-045-03,175 principle , that is all that need be required of it . It is a pity
b02-045-04,171 that the Government should ever have been led away
b02-045-05,169 from this principle . It is a great pity that the
b02-045-06,174 Government should give the appearance of responding , not
b02-045-07,173 to Mr Kaunda's reasonable representations , but to
b02-045-08,167 the violence which he tried to prevent .

a06-147-03,176 realization that West Germany would not survive even a few hours
a06-147-04,175 of a third world war . The best way to rule out such a tragic

a02-078-00,195 Sir Roy Welensky said today that he no
a02-078-01,194 longer accepted the good faith of Mr. Kenneth
a02-078-04,192 Party was a monster as vicious as the Zambia
a02-078-05,194 National Congress , which was led by Mr. Kaunda
a02-078-06,195 until he was outlawed in 1959 . The record
a02-078-07,196 of lawlessness among UNIP supporters went

c03-021a-03,185 strong maternal instinct to the unborn child
c03-021a-04,184 as much as to the expectant mother , who acts
c03-021a-05,184 as a protector and comforter to her in her
c03-021a-06,185 hour of need . He shares her room and gives
c03-021a-07,184 her his forlorn gift of companionship and sym-
c03-021a-08,181 pathy - " you need someone to love you while

f01-075-00,165 At one time it was thought that mind could indeed
f01-075-01,166 be analysed into discrete bits . These bits were
f01-075-02,165 identified as elementary sensations . These were
f01-075-03,164 thought to combine together to form compound
f01-075-04,164 experiences by analogy with the way atoms of
f01-075-05,162 matter combine to form molecular compounds .
f01-075-06,163 But this view led to too many difficulties and
f01-075-07,164 was finally abandoned . Nevertheless the search
f01-075-08,163 for basic units of mind has gone on and will
f01-075-09,163 doubtless continue , for it is the aim of science to
f01-075-10,162 discover ultimate units .

a01-038x-00,185 Mr. Macleod thought the two Rhodesian parties

b06-087-01,190 at the same time defend Britain . This
b06-087-02,188 was shown at the Scottish Trades Union
b06-087-03,188 Congress , representing 800,000 organised
b06-087-04,186 trade unionists , when it decided by overwhelming
b06-087-05,186 votes , to reaffirm the Scarborough decisions

a01-011-02,182 National Congress ( 400,000 ) will meet in London today
a01-011-03,182 to discuss a common course of action . Sir Roy is
a01-011-04,182 violently opposed to Africans getting an elected majority
a01-011-05,182 in Northern Rhodesia , but the Colonial Secretary ,
a01-011-06,182 Mr. Iain Macleod , is insisting on a policy of change .
b04-096-00,182 Under the Labour Government 18.1 per cent of the
b04-096-01,186 national income was spent on social services . The
b04-096-02,186 present figure is 19.5 per cent. There are many
b04-096-03,186 worthwhile targets for the Opposition . What a pity
b04-096-04,186 to aim at the wrong one ! MRS. MARCIA POWER ,

a05-029-00,177 Sir Francis is to hand over to Sir Richard
a05-029-01,177 as from Nov. 1 . The hand-over , due in
a05-029-02,180 September , was delayed because of the
a05-029-03,176 Berlin crisis . Mr. Watkinson and his advisers
a05-029-04,178 felt the change would be unwise at a
a05-029-05,176 moment # when attention had to be
a05-029-06,176 concentrated on possible need for important
a05-029-07,176 military operations . For this reason Sir

c03-007f-08,169 gral part of the story .
a04-023-00,172 Apart from their formal Admiralty House talks , followed by lunch
a04-023-01,172 given by Lady Dorothy Macmillan with Mrs. Kennedy and other
a04-023-02,172 guests present , Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Macmillan met three more
a04-023-03,172 times yesterday . In PARIS , Mr. Dean Rusk , U.S. Secretary of
a04-023-04,172 State , gave a 90-minute briefing on the Vienna talks to the
a04-081-00,182 The General Council of the Trades Union
a04-081-01,182 Congress should therefore consider the
a04-081-02,182 matter . Consideration should also be given
a04-081-03,172 to the regrouping of unions and the
a04-081-04,182 modification of their structures to
a04-081-05,172 meet the growing concentration of
a04-081-06,172 capital . Mr. Cooper argued that a
a04-081-07,172 common industrial contribution was
a04-081-08,172 urgent - particularly in unions serving
a04-081-09,172 workers in the same industry - along
g06-037k-00,182 God grant , however , that I may be a false prophet
g06-037k-01,182 & that all may go well . Sir R. Peel was here , I
g06-037k-02,182 understand , but an express took him off yesterday . '
g06-037k-03,182 While he was in Naples there had opened a new chapter
g06-037k-04,182 in the history of Anglesey's unceasing search for
g06-037k-05,182 an effective alleviation of his painful malady . None
g06-037k-06,182 of the numerous conventional remedies to which he
g06-037k-07,182 had been subjected ever since the symptoms had
g06-037k-08,182 first shown themselves seventeen years before
g06-037k-09,182 had had the slightest effect .
a04-069-00,203 To Mr. Macmillan , Mr Gaitskell said the
a04-069-01,203 Prime Minister should begin to take
a04-069-02,203 seriously the danger of the spread of nuclear
a04-069-04,203 to Macmillan that he should press , I hope
a04-069-05,203 with the agreement of Kennedy , in
a04-069-06,203 talks with the Soviet Union , for the establishment
a04-069-07,203 in central Europe of a zone of controlled
h05-012-00,179 5 . Other forms of war damage payment made by the Commission
h05-012-01,180 are highway payments , clearance payments ( for clearing remains of
h05-012-02,178 structures from " total loss " sites ) and church payments . Although
h05-012-03,180 differing in certain important ways from the ordinary cost of
h05-012-04,180 works payments , the sums paid under these heads have the
h05-012-05,177 common feature that they are all payments in respect of works
h05-012-06,177 which have been carried out .
b04-040-00,162 There is no reason whatsoever why he should reproach himself . The
b04-040-01,162 sisters had to quit as their home was falling down . And Mr. Crabb
b04-040-02,162 did his best for them , even driving them to a new house . John
b04-040-03,162 Crabb has the qualities of sympathy and understanding . Too
b04-040-04,162 often lacking in officialdom . MR. HENRY NEWTON of Acton

r03-084-00,172 I 'm afraid we can't take yours into account
r03-084-07,172 you 'll find that no insurance companies ,
r03-084-08,172 or building societies , for that matter , will
r03-084-09,172 allow for the wife's earnings .
b04-208-00,182 At the beginning of this wonderful century many
b04-208-01,182 people believed that there were no more worlds to
b04-208-02,182 conquer .
c06-076-00,196 I AM happy to report that I saw some-
c06-076-01,196 thing this week I have never before witnessed ,
c06-076-02,195 either in pictures or outside - a budgerigar
c06-076-03,195 playing a drunk scene , and playing it with
c06-076-04,194 perfect timing and technique . It gives one loud ,
c06-076-05,194 clear hiccup and falls flat on its back . This
c06-076-06,195 brilliant budge , I may add , gets no credit
c06-076-09,189 is either using a stand-in for the stunt
a04-085-00,172 Suggesting that a total T.U.C.
a04-085-01,172 membership of eight million was a " poor
a04-085-02,172 show " compared with some countries , he
a04-085-03,172 argued that the position needed examination .
a04-085-04,172 BEFORE President Kennedy met Mr.
a04-085-05,172 Macmillan yesterday morning he was given
a04-085-06,172 the views of a wide section of the
a04-085-07,172 British people about Polaris submarine
a04-085-08,172 bases in this country . An open letter
a04-085-09,172 written by Earl Russell hoping that the
b04-034-00,162 The Government should settle this argument with two words to
b04-034-01,162 the B.B.C. : - Go ahead ! ONE man beyond all others is saddened
b04-034-02,162 by the deaths of two elderly sisters who killed themselves because
b04-034-03,162 they had to leave their cottage . Mr. John Crabb , clerk to
b04-034-04,162 Newmarket urban council , says : " I shall always feel this as a
b04-034-05,162 personal failure . "
a05-039-01,177 towards the Nationalist party of Dr. Verwoerd ,
a05-039-02,177 the Prime Minister . This implies the dis-
a05-039-03,177 appearance of the Progressive party from
a05-039-05,178 general election showed Nationalists being
a05-039-06,175 returned in their strongholds , like Bloem-
a05-039-07,175 fontein and the Transvaal , with slightly
a05-039-08,176 increased majorities . In the Cape , the
a05-039-10,174 Lawrence , standing as a Progressive , was

a01-096u-04,169 has practised medicine for 43 years , chiefly
a01-096u-05,169 as a panel doctor . " I am a lifelong
a01-096u-06,171 Conservative . I am horrified and amazed
a01-096u-07,169 by my party's proposal to prostitute the
a01-096u-08,169 whole principle of the State service and
a01-096u-09,168 to render that service a hardship to poor
a01-096u-10,170 people .
c03-000b-00,153 The film version of Miss Shelagh Delaney's play A
c03-000b-01,152 Taste of Honey opens at the Leicester Square Theatre
c03-000b-02,153 tomorrow . It has been produced and directed by
c03-000b-03,153 Mr. Tony Richardson , who is also part-author with
c03-000b-04,150 Miss Delaney of the script , and the great advantages
c03-000b-05,150 to be derived from this unity of conception and control
c03-000b-06,152 are everywhere apparent .
f01-070-00,162 Can we now put forward any reasonably clear
f01-070-03,162 with the atomic theory , in giving a clear and detailed
f01-070-04,158 picture of the basis of such material phenomena
f01-070-05,159 as chemical action , magnetism , the behaviour of
f01-070-06,161 gases and so on . Where has psychology got to in its
f01-070-07,161 theories of " mind " ? Are there any ultimate units
f01-070-08,159 of mind akin to the atoms of matter ?
a02-124-00,187 Measures agreed so far include : 1 . A mass
a02-124-01,187 call-out of police , special constables
a02-124-02,186 and reserves , with 750 policemen posted
a02-124-03,186 from outlying districts to stations in
a02-124-04,185 the area - West End Central , Bow-street ,
a02-124-05,182 and Cannon-row .
a01-043x-00,181 Informal talks at Lancaster House will resume
a01-043x-01,177 today . PRESIDENT KENNEDY today defended
a01-043x-02,178 the appointment of a Negro as his Housing Minister .
a01-043x-03,171 It has aroused strong opposition from the anti-Negro
a01-043x-04,168 senators of the Deep South . The negro is Mr.
a01-043x-05,170 Robert Weaver of New York . One of his tasks
a01-043x-06,175 will be to see there is no racial discrimination
a01-043x-07,171 in Government and State housing projects .
g06-042m-00,182 Nor is this to be wondered at , for even today ,
g06-042m-01,182 in the 1960s , no cure has been found for the
g06-042m-02,182 6tic douloureux . As early as 1830 , when
g06-042m-03,182 Anglesey believed himself to be on the
g06-042m-04,182 point of death , the new German curative
g06-042m-05,182 method known as homoeopathy had
g06-042m-06,182 been brought to his notice .
e01-029-00,167 It will be seen how , with bold design
e01-029-01,169 and rich colour , knitting , crochet and
e01-029-02,169 tatting in fine and medium-weight cottons
e01-029-03,165 can give striking individuality to many things
e01-029-04,164 in the home . Chairbacks , cushions , tablecloths ,
e01-029-05,166 to mention only three - how satisfying it is
e01-029-06,168 to avoid the ready-made in these and by
e01-029-07,168 one's own handiwork produce something
e01-029-08,162 that reflects true creative talent .
g06-042k-00,182 Nor is this to be wondered at , for even today , in
g06-042k-01,182 the 1960s , no cure has been found for the
g06-042k-02,182 6tic douloureux . As early as 1830 , when Anglesey
g06-042k-03,182 believed himself to be on the point of death ,
g06-042k-04,182 the new German curative method known as
g06-042k-05,162 homoeopathy had been brought to his notice .
r06-035-00,171 No , he hadn't read it ; Madame did all the
r06-035-01,174 reading . Lawrence died in this very place .
r06-035-02,174 He used to come to Pierre's Bar again and
r06-035-04,174 him , he was one of the crowd . The
r06-035-05,173 sun came out ; Mart went shopping ; I
r06-035-06,173 sat in the square reading the Patriote .
b05-032-00,150 The travellers from the New World who had
b05-032-01,150 been in Britain many times before , were
b05-032-02,149 slightly stunned . Afterwards they said : " We thought
b05-032-03,149 we knew it all , but you Britishers never run
b05-032-04,147 out of unturned stones . "
b05-032-05,148 To the British Travel Association , doing their excellent
b05-032-06,147 darndest , I offer these sad complexities . IN the 1830's
b05-032-07,147 the Luddites took sledge-hammers to their looms and
b05-032-08,148 many a good trade unionist since then has , in the
b05-032-09,148 hope of improving the lot of his fellow workers , taken
b05-032-10,148 the theoretical Luddite hammer again .
b01-079-00,172 It is unjust to pass the buck to Mr.
b01-079-01,172 Hammarskjold and the UN's servants . The
b01-079-02,172 responsibility rightly belongs to the nations
b01-079-03,172 which have undertaken the task of pre-
b01-079-04,162 serving peace in the Congo . That is not a
b01-079-05,162 ceremonial duty , and the soldiers have every
b01-079-06,172 right to blame the politicians unless they see
b01-079-07,172 it through . When the United Nations instructed
b01-079-08,162 Mr. Hammarskjold to use force if necessary to
b01-079-09,172 prevent civil war , it was clear that new dangers
b01-079-10,172 would arise unless it gave him the political ...
g06-047h-00,182 This remarkable man of medicine , whom Sir Francis
g06-047h-01,186 Burdett described to Anglesey a year or two later as
g06-047h-02,186 ' more like a God upon earth than a human being ' ,
g06-047h-03,182 had an increasing number of disciples among
g06-047h-04,182 unorthodox medical men in the cities of Europe .
g06-047h-06,182 whom Anglesey consulted in May 1834 .
a04-006-00,172 Mr. Kennedy told Mr. Macmillan that he still
a04-006-01,172 wanted him to apply for membership of the Common
a04-006-02,172 Market , even if it meant an unconditional surrender .
a04-006-03,172 There were also brief discussions on Laos , Berlin
a04-006-04,172 and other foreign questions , after Mr. Kennedy had
a04-006-05,165 informed Mr. Macmillan of his discussions with Mr.
a04-006-07,172 Lord Home , Foreign Secretary , and Mr. McGeorge
a04-006-08,165 Bundy , the President's special assistant for
a04-006-09,172 security affairs , were brought in , the two
a04-006-10,172 men talked alone .
b06-059-00,182 It would become easy to become cynical and
b06-059-01,182 to despair . And yet , wherever the issues were put
b06-059-02,182 clearly , sections of the movement reaffirmed their
b06-059-03,186 original stand . Only where the issues were
b06-059-04,182 posed so as to cause doubt and confusion
b06-059-06,182 immediate confusion hides the fact that the
b06-059-07,182 Peace movement is still advancing and that
b06-059-08,182 clarification of the issues can bring a
b06-059-09,182 majority to # secure the Scarborough
b06-019-00,183 The process has been too slow for Herr
b06-019-01,186 Strauss and last month he attacked
b06-019-03,186 plans for a " unified supply apparatus "
b06-019-04,188 in Nato . ( A supply apparatus which would
b06-019-05,188 link together the various West German
b06-019-07,187 will be 11 German divisions in Nato
b06-019-08,189 compared with four divisions of
b06-019-09,186 British troops .
b04-195-00,182 It could be curtain up on two success stories . Of
b04-195-01,182 the old Palace . And Barry and Eric . DONS at
b04-195-02,182 Cambridge want the study of agriculture to become
b04-195-03,182 an honours degree course . Farming is Britain's
b04-195-04,182 most vital industry . It is increasingly dependent
b04-195-05,182 on new techniques - and on the universities to
b04-195-06,182 provide men of knowledge and skill .
e04-038-00,191 Avoid using lead-based paint as this could prove poisonous
e04-038-01,192 if junior decides to bite the chair . Finally , it is as well
e04-038-02,192 to cover the footrest with rubber or any such protective
e04-038-03,189 material that might be available as otherwise the
e04-038-04,190 paint would soon be scratched off .
e04-038-06,191 satisfying and worthwhile project .
a02-032-00,188 But in his absence his chief lieutenants have
a02-032-01,189 not let him down . The strong arm of authority has
a02-032-02,189 been raised against the strikers and is now beginning
a02-032-03,190 to tell . Today's Ghanaian Times ( motto : " The welfare
a02-032-04,189 of the people is the supreme law " ) reports : " The
a02-032-05,185 Government has been urged to take immediate ac-
a02-032-06,187 tion to deal ruthlessly with the strikers . "
a04-103-00,182 The third reason is that the supreme
a04-103-01,182 interest for the whole world - East and
a04-103-02,182 West and uncommitted nations - is the
a04-103-03,182 prevention of nuclear war . " A rapidly
a04-103-04,182 growing body of opinion in this country
a04-103-05,182 believes that Britain could be more effective
a04-103-06,182 in preventing a nuclear war as a neutral
a04-103-07,182 by helping to suggest agreements which could
a04-103-08,182 be accepted by both East and West . "
b01-009-00,191 The Archbishop has long been a courageous
b01-009-01,191 fighter against apartheid . He must be heard
b01-009-02,191 with attention . On purely practical grounds he
b01-009-03,191 holds that it would be a mistake to expel
b01-009-04,191 South Africa , weakening the whites who are
b01-009-05,182 working for a change of policy . In his view
b01-009-06,191 it would also be against the interests of the
b01-009-07,182 Africans .
e04-030-00,171 To complete the job , screw two fittings to the
e04-030-01,170 inside of the chair arms about 2 1/2 in. from the
e04-030-03,173 made by shaping and soldering two pieces of stout
e04-030-04,170 wire as shown in Fig. 6 . Make sure that these
e04-030-05,171 are well secured as they will have to withstand
e04-030-06,175 considerable pulling as the child becomes older .
g06-047m-00,182 This remarkable man of medicine , whom Sir
g06-047m-01,182 Francis Burdett described to Anglesey a
g06-047m-02,182 year or two later as ' more like a God
g06-047m-03,182 upon earth than a human being ' , had an
g06-047m-04,182 increasing number of disciples among
g06-047m-05,182 unorthodox medical men in the cities of
g06-047m-07,182 Dr Giuseppe Mauro , whom Anglesey
g06-047m-08,182 consulted in May 1834 .
g06-045e-02,162 to give the system a trial , adding that it was being
g06-045e-03,162 cultivated with extraordinary success in France and Italy ,
g06-045e-04,162 and that he himself was being treated under a doctor
g06-045e-05,162 who had studied under its founder , the aged Dr. Samuel
g06-045e-06,162 Hahnemann .
a05-004-00,189 Short of wearing the same uniform , which is
a05-004-01,187 not contemplated , the Navy , Army and Royal
a05-004-02,187 Air Force would become , for practical purposes ,
a05-004-03,187 a single defence force . There would be
a05-004-04,183 complete co-operation at all levels in training
a05-004-05,184 and operations . This would apply also in the
a05-004-06,183 command structure and central administrative
a05-004-08,184 has been working on the plan for some months ,
a02-086-00,174 " Against this background must be taken Mr.
a02-086-01,168 Kaunda's repeated statements that all he is
a02-086-03,172 Sir Roy . " I am now compelled to say that
a02-086-04,168 I don't accept his good faith . " He said
a02-086-05,164 Mr. Kaunda must know that his statements
a02-086-06,170 had stimulated violence , but he had done
a02-086-07,168 nothing to stop it .
a01-087-00,161 Mr. Brown , passionate and warm-hearted , led
a01-087-01,161 Labour's attack on the higher health
a01-087-02,161 charges . Mr. Powell , white-faced and outwardly
a01-087-03,161 unemotional , replied with a statistical state-
a01-087-04,161 ment - and ended by inciting Labour M Ps
a01-087-05,161 to angry uproar . One dealt with the human
a01-087-06,161 issue behind the Health Service ; the other
a01-087-08,161 always come first .

e01-059-01,179 hand-crocheted blouses , gossamer fine in
e01-059-02,178 texture , are sold at a very high price . With a
e01-059-03,179 little time and concentration the woman at home can
e01-059-04,175 produce fashion articles as elegant as those of
e01-059-05,178 Paris - a blouse , delicate gloves or a fine
e01-059-06,179 edging for collar , cuffs or a handkerchief .
g06-026g-00,169 A pleasant life truly ! ... It so happens that I have an Italian
g06-026g-01,172 who is perhaps the best Valet de Chambre that ever was . But
g06-026g-02,172 he has not one word of English . ' While he was writing this
g06-026g-03,172 letter he heard of the fall of the Whigs , and the temporary
g06-026g-04,172 assumption of the government by the Duke of Wellington .
g06-018c-00,182 When the sailing season was past , he sent Pearl back
g06-018c-01,182 to England , and returned to Rome for the winter . In
g06-018c-02,182 late November , he was ' suffering as usual ' , but hoped ,
g06-018c-03,182 he told Arthur , ' to find this place agree with
g06-018c-04,182 me better than Naples . The journey has been

a03-073-02,170 easier . He can point out that this is the
a03-073-03,171 only rocket and launcher in Europe to

a01-003-00,176 Though they may gather some Left-wing support , a
a01-003-01,176 large majority of Labour M Ps are likely to
a01-003-02,176 turn down the Foot-Griffiths resolution . Mr.
a01-003-03,176 Foot's line will be that as Labour M Ps
a01-003-04,161 opposed the Government Bill which brought
a01-003-05,176 life peers into existence , they should not
a01-003-06,176 now put forward nominees . He believes

b06-068-00,203 All recent events show how correct the
b06-068-01,203 Scarborough decisions were . The Kennedy

b06-068-03,203 speeded-up drive to improve West
b06-068-04,191 Germany's armament , the new attempt
b06-068-05,189 to rush Britain into the European Common
b06-068-06,191 Market , and the kite-flying on Spain
b06-068-07,203 present a whole new proof that to abandon
b06-068-08,189 Scarborough is to expose Britain and her
b06-068-09,191 working class to sharp new dangers - that
b06-068-10,189 Gaitskellism is bankrupt .
a05-104-00,187 Mr. Healey denounced the Government for
a05-104-01,187 using double standards . Ministers had
a05-104-02,188 rebuked the unaligned nations for not
a05-104-04,185 they themselves had no condemnation for
a05-104-05,180 events in Angola or Algeria . It was not for
a05-104-06,181 the Government , said Mr. Healey , to
a05-104-07,178 take up moral attitudes , " especially when
a05-104-08,181 the temple of their religion is the
a05-104-09,179 bingo-parlour . "
e01-035-00,181 For in the old order of things , men designed
e01-035-01,183 and worked lace as well as women and
e01-035-02,181 special schools were set up to teach lace-
e01-035-03,180 making not only to young girls , but to little
e01-035-05,172 livelihood by lace-making and consequently
e01-035-06,179 a folklore of song , festival and courtship grew
e01-035-07,178 up around the lace industry .
a06-124-00,179 The big " squeeze " means that it is going to be more
a06-124-01,177 difficult to arrange a loan or overdraft . And banks will be
a06-124-02,177 stricter in recalling existing overdrafts . This is underlined in
a06-124-03,178 the Central Bank's weekly return ... ... which shows that more
a06-124-04,180 than 163,000,000 of the banks' money is now frozen in the
a06-124-05,179 form of special deposits with the Bank of England .
a06-020-00,182 He was announcing his executive's rejection of the ultimatum to the
a06-020-01,182 ETU. In reply to the call for his resignation he said : " Our rules
a06-020-02,182 say that if an official resigns he is not allowed to run again
a06-020-03,182 for three years . " I have only 2 1/2 years to go before I retire ,
a06-020-04,182 so this is an invitation from my good friends of the TUC that
a06-020-05,179 I should commit hara-kiri .
b04-121-00,162 But if it fails to modify that plan Rhodesia may well
b04-121-01,162 be plunged into chaos , like the Congo . For Mr.
b04-121-02,162 Macmillan and his ministers there is no choice . They
b04-121-03,162 must safeguard Rhodesia against chaos . And try to
b04-121-04,162 repair the damage they have done . WHO can grow the
b04-121-05,162 fastest ? That is the exciting competition going on
b04-121-06,162 among Britain's major industries .

b04-047-00,162 He says that the Scots are foreigners who have no business to
b04-047-01,162 be in England . The first ruler of the United Kingdom was a
b04-047-02,162 Scot . The Lord Chancellor is a Scot . The Prime Minister is a
b04-047-03,162 Scot - and so were four of his predecessors this # century .
b04-047-04,162 Let Mr. Newton beware . By protesting against Scotland he
b04-047-05,162 may be guilty of rebellion !
b06-075-00,189 At the same time that unity cannot be
b06-075-01,190 established on a false basis , or by creating
b06-075-02,188 further confusion within the movement . Unity
b06-075-03,190 will never be established on the basis of leaders
b06-075-04,189 being a law unto themselves and opposing
b06-075-05,188 conference decisions when it suits their own
b06-075-06,188 convenience . Unity can never be established by
b06-075-07,188 any formula uniting those who oppose German
b06-075-08,188 troops being trained on British soil and Polaris ,
b06-075-09,188 and those who are for this policy - which is the
b06-075-10,186 same as that of the Tory Government .

a04-015-03,172 both economic and political , and revealed once again the
a04-015-04,172 close agreement of the two Governments in pursuing their
a04-015-05,172 common purposes . " Occasion was given to review the need for
a04-015-06,172 economic co-operation and expansion in the general interests

r06-130-01,184 doorman was lying in wait for anyone

b01-132-03,189 South Africa that Dr. Verwoerd is leading them
b01-132-04,182 to disaster . It may be that the Commonwealth
b01-132-05,182 Prime Ministers will decide against this final
b01-132-06,182 step . If that is their decision they should also
b01-132-07,182 go unequivocally on record that they regard

b04-075-00,186 They intend to sit outside the Ministry of Defence . It is
b04-075-01,186 their protest against the H-bomb . They ought to have a
b04-075-02,186 pleasant time . The weather forecast is good ; except for them ,
b04-075-03,186 Whitehall should be deserted . And they will have a fine view
b04-075-04,186 of St. James's Park , with its placid lake , pelicans ,

g04-007-00,167 The Hall proved most useful , especially in winter
g04-007-01,165 when the distance to the church deterred many from
g04-007-02,165 coming to Sunday Evensong . We managed to furnish
g04-007-03,165 a table with cross and candles , and the people
g04-007-04,164 appreciated the Church Hall for worship as well
g04-007-05,164 as for more secular purposes . In 1910 Dr. Talbot
g04-007-06,163 was translated to Winchester , and Dr. Hubert

e07-061-00,160 Meanwhile Mr. Moncrieff had sent me an
e07-061-01,162 egg-case of the Chinese mantis . The
e07-061-02,159 first mantis had hatched from the very large
e07-061-03,160 egg-case on June 6 . Both the Chinese

e07-061-05,154 at any rate , are light brown in colour .
e07-061-06,157 Because of the cool , wet weather , I had great
e07-061-07,157 difficulty in breeding fruit flies and , after

b06-036-00,176 Now the argument is being used that Nato must be maintained
b06-036-01,174 and Britain must stay in it to keep the Germans in
b06-036-02,175 control . Nato , far from being a means of controlling
b06-036-03,177 the German militarists , is , in fact , the cover for
b06-036-04,173 building up their power . What must Britain do ? Today ,
b06-036-05,174 again , she has a key role . Let her tell men like Strauss
b06-036-07,173 his quest for atomic arms .
c04-080-00,176 Then he tried it out for sound . Um-chink ...
c04-080-01,180 um-chink ... it went . Slightly flat and jangly in
c04-080-02,178 part . DELIGHTFUL ! He put the sound on tape . The

c04-080-04,177 days Mr. Lisbon had a record contract . And they

a01-026x-03,187 future . The Northern Rhodesia conference in

e07-083-00,141 Every garden boy will agree that having to
e07-083-01,140 wash clay pots is a definite factor in
e07-083-02,139 favour of their abolition ; in fact one
e07-083-03,141 young man was so wholehearted about this
e07-083-04,138 a few years ago that he made the headlines
e07-083-05,136 for having smashed a large number # to
e07-083-06,137 relieve his feelings . On the small-to-medium
e07-083-07,139 establishment , it is a disagreeable chore
e07-083-08,138 which nobody tackles with any enthusiasm ,
e07-083-09,137 whereas on larger establishments the pots
e07-083-10,137 can be sterilized or washed by machine .

g06-047l-04,182 unorthodox medical men in the cities of Europe .
g06-047l-05,182 One of these was the Neapolitan , Dr Giuseppe Mauro ,
g06-047l-06,182 whom Anglesey consulted in May 1834 .

b04-054-00,186 ARCHBISHOP MAKARIOS puts the Commonwealth on trial .
b04-054-01,188 His ex-Eoka Government decides that Cyprus will join it for
b04-054-02,186 five years . During this period Britain will be expected
b04-054-03,182 to subsidise and defend the Cypriots . They will enjoy
b04-054-04,189 all the trading benefits of Imperial Preference . It is a
b04-054-05,186 safe bet that at the end of five years Makarios and
b04-054-06,186 company will sign on again .
a04-096-00,182 The second reason is concerned with doubts
a04-096-01,182 as to the safety of the people of Great Britain ;
a04-096-02,182 " in the time of crisis it would probably be
a04-096-03,182 impossible for the British authorities to
a04-096-04,182 exercise any degree of control over the action
a04-096-05,182 of Polaris submarines . " He argues that
a04-096-06,182 there is a distinct possibility that so long
a04-096-07,182 as there is a Polaris base in Britain the
a04-096-08,182 Soviet Union might retaliate against
a04-096-09,182 Britain alone .
g06-026i-00,162 A pleasant life truly ! ... It so happens that I have

g06-026i-03,162 While he was writing this letter he heard of the fall

a01-077-00,184 And , since this is election year in West
a01-077-01,183 Germany , Dr. Adenauer is in a tough
a01-077-02,182 spot . Joyce Egginton cables : President
a01-077-03,182 Kennedy at his Washington Press con-
a01-077-04,182 ference admitted he did not know
a01-077-05,182 whether America was lagging behind
a01-077-06,179 Russia in missile power . He said he
a01-077-07,182 was waiting for his senior military
a01-077-08,179 aides to come up with the answer on
a01-077-09,182 February 20 .
a02-098-00,163 Its terms have set the Prime Minister an exacting
a02-098-02,163 strong reaction from Sir Roy Welensky to any
a02-098-03,163 suggestion that there may be fresh concessions to the
a02-098-05,160 from talks with Sir John Moffat , Northern Rhodesian
a02-098-06,160 Liberal leader , and Mr. Kaunda , that the bulk
a02-098-07,161 of moderates and Africans will reject the

a01-082u-01,172 face from his warnings during the
a01-082u-02,172 Presidential election campaign . He claimed
a01-082u-03,171 slackness in the Eisenhower Administration
a01-082u-04,172 had caused America to lag behind Russia
a01-082u-05,170 in nuclear development . President Kennedy

a05-058-00,181 " We must not be rattled into surrender ,
a05-058-01,182 but we must not - and I am not - be
a05-058-02,183 afraid of negotiation . " Mr. Godber ,
a05-058-03,183 Minister of State , Foreign Office , said
a05-058-04,184 earlier that the Government had asked
a05-058-05,181 the Medical Research Council to reassess
a05-058-06,181 the fall-out position in view of the Russian
a05-058-07,183 tests . The Council's findings would be

c01-014-00,182 The libretto , by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman ,
c01-014-01,189 is largely a satire on the petty court
c01-014-03,182 egocentric character leads him to sacrifice
c01-014-04,182 everything to his need of inspiration . Henze
c01-014-05,189 obtains his musical characterisation by means
c01-014-07,182 intervals , and the result is often less delineation
c01-014-08,182 of character than caricature . This is also the chief ,
c01-014-09,182 or at least the most successfully executed trait
g06-031g-00,182 ' What a frightful event ! ' he wrote . ' I tremble ! What
g06-031g-01,182 infatuation ! Personally I am indifferent , but I really
g06-031g-02,182 tremble for my country ! I may be mistaken , 1tho' I cannot
g06-031g-03,182 but fear that the exasperation of the People will be so great
g06-031g-04,182 at the return of Ultratoryism , that the Commons House
g06-031g-05,162 upon a dissolution , which must be had , will be a mass
g06-031g-06,182 of Radicalism , & then God knows what may happen ... .
e07-076-00,136 The main disadvantage of the clay pot is its
e07-076-01,137 brittle nature ; even with reasonably careful
e07-076-02,136 handling , the annual losses are often around
e07-076-03,137 10 per cent. , and where the handling and
e07-076-04,135 storage facilities are not too good , these
e07-076-05,135 losses will be even greater . This does not
e07-076-06,136 necessarily apply to the larger sizes , as
e07-076-07,137 they are not quite so fragile as the
e07-076-09,138 about in quite the same way .
a06-095-00,182 Mr. Macmillan said we could be more help
a06-095-01,182 to the Commonwealth through the
a06-095-02,183 strength we would gain in the Common
a06-095-03,183 Market than by isolation . He paid
a06-095-04,187 tribute to the development of the
a06-095-05,182 Common Market . " The Community
a06-095-06,187 ( Common Market ) has imparted an
a06-095-07,183 impetus and an economic growth
a06-095-08,183 to The Six . Above all , it is an idea
a06-095-09,182 which has gripped men's minds , "
a06-095-10,182 he said .
a03-047-00,187 It is difficult for many to see Mr. Pearson

a03-047-02,186 hustings , the spellbinder that Mr. Diefen-
a03-047-03,186 baker was in the last two campaigns . The
a03-047-04,184 impression remains that the Liberal leader
a03-047-05,183 is still the diplomatist , more at home
a03-047-06,182 in the chancery , or the corridors of the United
a03-047-07,182 Nations , not the father figure , so necessary
a03-047-08,180 in Canadian leadership , or the practical
a03-047-09,179 politician , able to talk about sewage problems
a03-047-10,181 in Algoma East .

e07-105-04,148 The various types of small paper pots are very

a06-051-02,148 Fell appeared to be in tears as he sat
a06-051-03,150 down . A few minutes later , Mr. Fell got up
a06-051-04,148 and left the chamber . He returned five
a06-051-05,148 minutes later to stand just inside the
a06-051-06,148 doorway looking more composed . In the
a06-051-07,148 middle of the amazing scene , Mr. Macmillan
a06-051-08,145 waved his hand at Mr. Fell .
a05-022-00,174 It is thought this would be the minimum
a05-022-01,177 necessary for the extended training modern
a05-022-02,176 arms require and to enable each man to
a05-022-03,176 serve at least a year overseas . There is
a05-022-04,174 no truth in suggestions that Mr. Watkinson

b06-110-01,174 prefer unskilled jobs . Countless numbers who want training
b06-110-02,176 are denied it . One area electricity board in 1958
b06-110-03,177 offered six craft apprenticeships and received 450
b06-110-04,173 applications , of whom 100 were considered suitable by
b06-110-05,174 the board . There were only 17 vacancies for the 58

e02-086-00,176 Coming now to the actual tools and their cost , we begin
e02-086-01,173 with what we have called a bare minimum kit . Probably
e02-086-02,174 most men have some of the tools already . It will enable
e02-086-03,174 a man to make simple , straight-forward things , and in
e02-086-04,168 any case may be regarded as a good beginning to
e02-086-05,168 which other tools can be added as the need arises . The
e02-086-06,174 nature of the work will probably dictate the additions
e02-086-07,175 to be made , but as a guide we have given a fuller kit

a06-064-02,182 This apparently , was Mr. Macmillan's assessment .
a06-064-03,182 He confined his reply to the observation
a06-064-04,182 that Mr. Fell had probably " maximised his
a06-064-05,179 support . " There were no other attacks
a06-064-06,181 of such ferocity . But there was ample
a06-064-07,181 evidence of Conservative and Labour
a06-064-08,181 opposition , which will be aired in the

b03-104-00,182 It is true that SIR GRAHAM said there is
b03-104-01,182 at the moment " an awful mess up " in
b03-104-02,182 the measurement of temperatures . This ,
b03-104-03,182 however , seems a matter of the convenience
b03-104-04,182 of specialists . The ordinary British man
b03-104-05,182 and woman is conscious of no difficulty .
b03-104-06,182 Rather than fifty million people having
b03-104-07,182 to be put out for the sake of 50,000 is there
b03-104-08,182 any reason why the centigrade countries
b03-104-09,182 should not change to fahrenheit ?
f01-143-01,173 directly look into the mental processes of another
f01-143-02,173 person they observe his visible behaviour and then try
f01-143-03,175 to give theoretical interpretations of what lies behind
f01-143-04,174 this behaviour . This is no more queer than the method
f01-143-05,172 of the doctor who observes signs , and records symptoms ,
f01-143-06,174 and diagnoses the inner states responsible for them .
r06-106-00,185 The day I promised to take Catherine
r06-106-01,184 down to visit my young friend Philip
r06-106-02,185 at his school in the country , we were
r06-106-03,184 to leave at eleven , but she arrived
r06-106-04,185 at nine . Her blue dress was new ,
r06-106-05,183 and so were her fashionable shoes . Her
r06-106-06,183 hair had just been done . She looked
r06-106-07,184 more than ever like a pink and gold
r06-106-08,182 Renoir girl who expects everything from
r06-106-09,181 life .
e02-094-00,156 Lastly , we suggest certain power tools and
e02-094-01,159 machines , the choice of which will
e02-094-02,159 depend partly upon the space available
e02-094-03,155 in the workshop , the amount one
e02-094-04,155 is prepared to pay , and the type of
e02-094-05,162 work a man normally does . First ,
e02-094-06,162 however , a word of advice generally .
e02-094-07,157 Do not buy so-called cheap tools or
e02-094-08,158 machines . They never are cheap in the
e02-094-09,162 long run . They may be inaccurate ,
r02-065-00,191 They closed on a single bundle and , fumbling with
r02-065-01,182 nervous excitement , he pulled it out . His eye
r02-065-02,182 rested on a wad of stiff white paper printed on one
r02-065-03,182 side . ' Old fashioned fivers ! ' he muttered again , and
r02-065-04,182 tried to recall if they were still legal tender . Surely the
r02-065-05,182 Govr. and Compa. of the Bank of England would never
r02-065-06,182 break their promise to pay on rude demand , let
r02-065-07,182 alone on polite request .
f03-174-00,191 So - see the next page ! Yes , they are waiting for you .
f03-174-01,182 But there is no need to be frightened . The audience
f03-174-02,182 will eat out of your hand - if they like what
f03-174-03,191 you offer them . A good start will put them in a
f03-174-04,191 good humour . Ladies and gentlemen ! I 'm afraid
f03-174-05,182 I have not had much experience of public speaking .
b03-025-00,175 But discussion on current points of east-west con-
b03-025-01,175 flict could not go much farther than , for example , the
b03-025-02,175 truism that policies of menace and mutual disarmament
b03-025-03,175 cannot be followed together . What the council has done -
b03-025-04,175 and it is an achievement - is to make religious con-
b03-025-05,162 tact across the greatest political barrier in what
b03-025-06,175 is not yet a unitary world .
e04-011-00,166 See Fig. 2 . These are then glued and
e04-011-01,167 pinned into place . A similar piece of 1 in.

e04-011-03,165 the end of the feeding tray as seen in
e04-011-04,167 Fig. 3 which also shows how a piece of
e04-011-05,164 hardboard is covered with plastic material
e04-011-06,165 for easy cleaning and then fixed underneath

b05-038-04,150 developed by a firm specialising in electronics
b05-038-05,148 in Los Angeles . They have developed a new
b05-038-06,150 system whereby completely untrained workers
b05-038-07,150 can be taught their trade by means of tape

b02-013-04,191 have us run risks greater than the West
b02-013-05,189 ought to run - and greater than President
b02-013-06,187 Kennedy's most influential advisers seem
b02-013-07,187 disposed to face . The real question is
b02-013-09,190 Government as a basis for talks : and
f02-030-00,182 The original scheme was planned to provide short re-
f02-030-01,182 fresher courses at the ages of fifty-five and sixty :
f02-030-04,182 working out his ideas , either through the company's
f02-030-05,182 personnel department or by an approach to
f02-030-06,182 members of the panel responsible for the scheme .

g04-101-01,165 lived on in Purley - have always been

r06-000-01,184 town and village , pigeon grey , sly with arches , and

b01-127-03,182 what , in fact , can the other Commonwealth countries
b01-127-04,182 do to bring support and comfort to this gallant
b01-127-05,182 minority ? THERE is no evidence that the
b01-127-06,189 policy of appeasement has modified the
b01-127-07,189 actions of the Nationalists . On the contrary ,
b01-127-08,189 apartheid is being applied ever more

a01-063u-02,170 The President will probably discuss the
a01-063u-03,169 problem with Dr. Brentano , the West German
a01-063u-04,168 Foreign Minister , who is due in Washington
a01-063u-05,169 next week . A big slice of Germany's " aid "
a01-063u-06,169 is the early payment of a 210million
a01-063u-07,168 debt to America . United States officials
a01-063u-08,167 quickly point out that this is money due
a01-063u-09,169 to America anyway .
a01-128-00,160 When Mr. Brown sat down Labour M Ps cheered for
a01-128-01,160 a full minute - and even his bitterest opponents
a01-128-04,160 on which indeed the Government is making progress .
a01-128-05,160 His basic defence of the Health Service cuts was that
a01-128-06,160 " even after the proposed changes the net cost of the
a01-128-08,160 three years by 20 per cent.
a01-132-01,176 development being limited or an
a01-132-02,176 adjustment being made in financing . "
a01-132-03,176 The Government decided to adjust
a01-132-04,176 the financing - which Mr. Powell
a01-132-05,176 claimed was underpinning - not
a01-132-06,176 undermining - the service . Answering the
a01-132-07,176 attack on " economic charges " for welfare
a01-132-08,176 foods , Mr. Powell said that all these
a01-132-09,176 foods would still be free in families
a01-132-10,176 receiving regular National Assistance
a05-017-00,179 The Minister regards the recent trend
a05-017-01,176 of recruiting figures as encouraging .
a05-017-02,179 He is confident the aim can be achieved .
a05-017-03,175 While the possibility of an eventual return
a05-017-04,176 to National Service in some form
a05-017-05,173 cannot be entirely discounted , he does
a05-017-06,173 not agree that the point has been reached
a05-017-08,172 National Service is ever resorted to ,
a05-017-09,173 engagement would probably have to be for
a05-017-10,173 three years .
b06-015-00,177 A 90-day war , the West German

b06-015-02,177 German armed forces ( within Nato

b06-015-05,179 In the past year West Germany
b06-015-06,183 has secured agreements for
b06-015-08,182 Belgium . After much bargaining
b06-015-09,182 the British Government has
b06-015-10,181 agreed to give similar " facilities "

r06-027-03,182 We had a morning at Pierre's . He talked about people .
r06-027-04,183 Marc Chagall used to live here and an Englishman named
r06-027-05,182 Lawrence . He was here , near the railway station , three or
r06-027-06,181 four years . During this period he wrote a book ,
r06-027-07,181 The Lover of Lady Chatterly .
r06-057-01,176 You can free-wheel down a quarter of the
r06-057-02,174 way . In the middle of the journey is a
r06-057-03,173 valley with a sea of vines and olives
r06-057-04,173 and beaches of earth pricked to blood by
r06-057-05,174 the hoe . Rising from the flecked sea are

c04-056-01,167 comics bolted in and out of holes so often .
c04-056-02,169 The jokes were a reshuffle of the same old
c04-056-03,167 lot - this time Brian Rix lost his skirt instead
c04-056-04,169 of his trousers . The action moved at tremendous
c04-056-05,170 speed , backed by some wonderful timing by
c04-056-06,168 the cast . I especially liked the tea-cup
c04-056-08,166 cups with the dexterity of Chinese jugglers .
e04-068-00,171 I have also included a sketch of paddles I make for
e04-068-02,168 and easy to make . As will be seen from the plan
e04-068-03,168 there is only a single gunwale on the outside .

g06-031b-04,162 but fear that the exasperation of
g06-031b-05,162 the People will be so great at the
g06-031b-06,162 return of Ultratoryism , that the
g06-031b-07,162 Commons House upon a dissolution ,
g06-031b-08,162 which must be had , will be a mass
g06-031b-09,162 of Radicalism , & then God knows what
b01-094-01,172 they must go . The best news for the Congo
b01-094-02,172 would be agreement between its rival
b01-094-03,172 political leaders . Through the patient efforts
b01-094-04,172 of UN conciliators they are meeting for

b01-094-09,162 can recognise .
r02-006-00,182 At one point the astute Miss Cheesecake
r02-006-01,182 had claimed tax relief on the pur-
r02-006-02,182 chase of several mink coats which ,
r02-006-03,182 it seemed , were necessary to fur-
r02-006-04,182 ther her career . Alternatively , it
r02-006-05,182 was reported , she tearfully claimed
r02-006-06,182 that the warm coats were heating
r02-006-07,182 appliances and therefore susceptible
r02-006-08,182 to a depreciation tax allowance
r02-006-09,182 as plant and machinery . The
a04-054-00,172 That argument did not apply to the Polaris submarine .
a04-054-01,172 So long as the Soviet Union had nuclear weapons ,
a04-054-02,172 the West , somewhere , must have them too . It
a04-054-03,172 was far better for a weapon used for retaliatory
a04-054-04,172 purposes to be under the sea rather than on land .
a04-054-05,172 This was why the Labour Party did not think it right
a04-054-06,172 to oppose the Polaris depot ship .
a06-044-01,165 and added : " It is the most disastrous thing any Prime
a06-044-02,162 Minister has done for many , many generations . " He
a06-044-03,165 concluded : " The best service the Prime Minister can do
a06-044-04,165 would be to resign . " The outburst shocked MPs of
a06-044-05,162 all parties . Even close friends were signalling Mr. Fell

c03-000e-07,178 control are everywhere apparent .
a04-059-00,182 The party agreed that it was unwise to locate the base
a04-059-01,172 in the Holy Loch , only 30 miles from Glasgow , a
a04-059-02,172 city with two million people . It should be sited
a04-059-03,172 in a more remote area . Mr. Gaitskell added that
a04-059-04,172 the Scarborough conference decisions did not , in his
a04-059-05,172 view , truly reflect the opinions of the majority
a04-059-07,172 supporters in the country .

c03-003e-01,176 ceived throughout in terms of the cinema ,
c03-003e-02,177 and again and again it is the visual qualities
c03-003e-03,177 of the story , and the marriage of the central

g06-042e-00,162 Nor is this to be wondered at , for even today , in the
g06-042e-01,162 1960s , no cure has been found for the 6tic
g06-042e-02,162 douloureux . As early as 1830 , when Anglesey believed
g06-042e-03,162 himself to be on the point of death , the new German
g06-042e-04,162 curative method known as homoeopathy had been
g06-042e-05,152 brought to his notice .

a01-087u-03,170 outwardly unemotional , replied with a
a01-087u-04,168 statistical statement - and ended by inciting
a01-087u-05,168 Labour M Ps to angry uproar . One dealt
a01-087u-06,172 with the human issue behind the Health
a01-087u-07,171 Service ; the other tried to show that the

r03-030-05,224 seemed to her the princely sum of six hund-

e04-132-00,172 While these may ultimately be made into a picture

a02-106-04,179 The question : Their status in an independent Uganda .
a02-106-05,180 The thorniest problem for next week's conference is
a02-106-06,183 to settle the relationships between them and the
a02-106-07,183 rest of the country . A Government report has
a02-106-08,181 recognised their rights and recommended a form of
a02-106-09,182 federal association , but the four kings are not

a03-080-06,167 to German participation is the absence of
a03-080-07,170 any Ministry or Minister directly responsible
a03-080-08,169 for it - and therefore of any budget
a03-080-09,167 under which funds could be appropriated .
a05-025-00,174 Criticisms about Army manpower appear
a05-025-01,176 to have come mainly from retired officers
a05-025-03,175 are out of touch with the existing situation .
a05-025-04,174 Mr. Watkinson has had the utmost support
a05-025-05,174 from the C.I.G.S. , Field-Marshal Sir
a05-025-06,174 Francis Festing , who believes completely
a05-025-07,172 in the principle of an all-Regular army .
a05-025-08,173 Gen. Sir Richard Hull , who is to succeed
a05-025-09,172 Sir Francis , is equally convinced Mr.

a01-058-00,152 PRESIDENT KENNEDY is ready to get tough
a01-058-01,152 over West Germany's cash offer to help
a01-058-03,152 He said bluntly in Washington yester-
a01-058-04,152 day that the offer - 357million - was
a01-058-07,152 Germany to pay more . He did not
a01-058-08,152 mention personal talks with Dr.
a01-058-09,152 Adenauer , the West German Chancellor .
g06-011c-00,182 By the end of the month he still delighted in
g06-011c-01,182 Naples . He told Cloncurry that he enjoyed it as
g06-011c-02,182 much as his health permitted him to enjoy anything .
g06-011c-03,182 ' The Pearl ' , he wrote , ' is arrived , which is a great
g06-011c-04,182 resource . Vesuvius seems to be tired ; he is going
g06-011c-05,182 out fast ... . What a gay , lively people , and what
g06-011c-06,182 a busy town . At Rome , every other man was a
g06-011c-07,182 priest : here the priest is 1superceded by the
g06-011c-08,182 soldier - a favourable change in my eye , particularly
g06-011c-09,182 as the troops are very fine . '
a03-050-02,162 still regard him " as some sort of cross
a03-050-03,164 between an egghead and a missionary " .
a03-050-04,162 His party advisers are now trying to
a03-050-05,160 correct that image . The bow tie has
a03-050-06,161 gone ; he is having lessons on
a03-050-07,162 television techniques and is being coached
a03-050-08,161 by speech experts .
a05-080-00,179 Mr. Macmillan explained that he had deliber-
a05-080-01,184 ately refrained during the summer from
a05-080-02,183 recalling Parliament or ordering mobilisation
a05-080-03,182 by proclamation , such as would be
a05-080-05,175 on to a fully active footing . That
a05-080-06,179 would have created a thoroughly unde-
a05-080-07,178 sirable atmosphere of panic . He thought
a05-080-08,176 that the situation was rather more
a05-080-09,174 hopeful .
g06-047b-00,164 This remarkable man of medicine , whom Sir Francis
g06-047b-01,164 Burdett described to Anglesey a year or two
g06-047b-02,161 later as ' more like a God upon earth than
g06-047b-03,160 a human being ' , had an increasing number
g06-047b-04,160 of disciples among unorthodox medical men
g06-047b-05,158 in the cities of Europe . One of these
g06-047b-06,160 was the Neapolitan , Dr Giuseppe Mauro ,
g06-047b-07,161 whom Anglesey consulted in May 1834 .
c03-081f-00,173 Arguably , the dramatist has committed a
c03-081f-01,174 technical error in allowing Irene to speak
c03-081f-02,175 for herself ; we would be altogether clearer
c03-081f-03,170 in our minds about her if she remained a
c03-081f-04,169 flawed but beautiful enigma , seen but not
c03-081f-05,172 heard . However , Miss Pinkie Johnstone
c03-081f-06,174 makes her few brief scenes effective , and
c03-081f-07,170 Mr. Dinsdale Landen , in the longest and most
c03-081f-09,173 performance of rare intelligence and restrained
g06-031i-01,162 infatuation ! Personally I am indifferent , but I really tremble
g06-031i-02,162 for my country ! I may be mistaken , 1tho' I cannot but
g06-031i-03,162 fear that the exasperation of the People will be so
g06-031i-04,162 great at the return of Ultratoryism , that the Commons

c03-021c-00,188 In Fanny the pregnant girl is befriended by an
c03-021c-01,186 old man . Here it is a young homosexual , estranged
c03-021c-02,186 from women but yet moved by a strong maternal
c03-021c-03,185 instinct to the unborn child as much as to the
c03-021c-04,182 expectant mother , who acts as a protector and
c03-021c-06,185 shares her room and gives her his forlorn gift
c03-021c-07,186 of companionship and sympathy - " you need someone
c03-021c-08,182 to love you while you are looking for
c03-021c-09,182 someone to love " .
a05-089-00,186 The early speakers in the debate each
a05-089-01,185 severely rated the speech of his predecessor .
a05-089-02,183 These strictures were all too well justified .
a05-089-03,183 We started with the plaintive wailings
a05-089-04,183 of Mr. Healey , " Shadow " Foreign Secretary ,
a05-089-05,181 described by Mr. Godber , Minister of
a05-089-06,180 State , Foreign Office , as " pedantic and
a05-089-07,183 obscure on Berlin , damaging and obscure
a05-089-09,180 censured by Mr. Shinwell , former Labour
a05-089-10,182 Defence Minister , for having read the
a01-053-01,152 alleged association with organisations black-
a01-053-02,152 listed by the Government . Immediately
a01-053-03,152 Mr. Kennedy rushed a letter to Senator
a01-053-06,152 He believed he would perform " outstanding
a01-053-07,152 service " in his post . Senator Robertson's
a01-053-09,152 nomination before it can be con-
a01-053-10,152 # sidered by the full Senate .
a05-000-00,169 THE next White Paper on defence , to
a05-000-01,171 be published in March , is likely to
a05-000-02,170 contain a five-year plan for the three
a05-000-03,171 Services . Its aim will be to produce superbly
a05-000-04,171 equipped , all-Regular forces of
a05-000-05,168 about 400,000 men . The three Services
a05-000-06,170 would be " integrated " to a greater
a05-000-07,172 extent than ever before .

a01-020-00,176 Mr. Macleod went on with the conference at
a01-020-01,176 Lancaster House despite the crisis which had
a01-020-02,176 blown up . He has now revealed his full plans
a01-020-03,176 to the Africans and Liberals attending . These
a01-020-04,176 plans do not give the Africans the overall
a01-020-05,176 majority they are seeking . African delegates
a01-020-06,176 are studying them today . The conference
a01-020-07,176 will meet to discuss the function of a
a01-020-08,176 proposed House of Chiefs .
c03-094a-00,187 Mr. William Lucas ( Morris ) is always insensi-

c03-094a-02,187 always palely appealing , Mr. James Maxwell ,
c03-094a-03,186 the editor , always comically abashed by the
c03-094a-04,183 events , and Mr. Aubrey Richards , the father-in-
c03-094a-05,184 law , always comically grotesque ; they were
c03-094a-06,185 not asked to modulate from their set moods
c03-094a-08,185 the case of Mr. Richards , with lavish and
c03-094a-09,185 suitably gaudy colour .

a04-003-00,172 It arose during talks following
a04-003-01,172 President Kennedy's report to the British
a04-003-02,172 Prime Minister of the outcome of his recent
a04-003-03,172 visit to Paris . There General de Gaulle had made
a04-003-04,172 clear that he would accept Britain into the
a04-003-05,172 Common Market only if there were no conditions
a04-003-06,172 laid down to meet the Commonwealth
a04-003-07,172 and other reservations .
c02-056-00,182 This director is at last being re-evaluated and
c02-056-01,181 given his proper place in the history of the
c02-056-02,182 German film . Most charming was his tongue-in-cheek
c02-056-03,183 " Unheimliche Geschichten " ( 1920 ) , five ghost stories
c02-056-04,181 with a light touch , and there was much to admire
c02-056-06,180 but extremely important " 1914 " ( 1931 ) , which
c02-056-07,181 tries to show that it took more than just
c02-056-08,180 Germany to start the First World War .
c03-084c-00,186 Mr. Bryan Stonehouse's production is quietly effective ,
c03-084c-05,184 was a morality on the not unfamiliar theme of
c03-084c-06,184 the destructive power of unbridled ambition .

g06-026d-03,182 While he was writing this letter he heard of the fall of
g06-026d-04,182 the Whigs , and the temporary assumption of the govern-
g06-026d-05,182 ment by the Duke of Wellington .

b01-113-00,162 ONLY a man wrapped in the impenetrable cocoon of what he regards
b01-113-01,162 as a divine mission could have spoken of apartheid as " a
b01-113-02,162 policy of good neighbourliness . " We may be sure that
b01-113-03,162 he is not being hypocritical . That is what he
b01-113-04,162 really believes . A good neighbour to those Africans
b01-113-05,162 who , under apartheid , will be forced back to
b01-113-06,162 their tribal reserves with no prospect but a
b01-113-07,162 cramped and primitive existence .
a06-141-00,178 BRITAIN - One cannot but wonder at British bases being
a06-141-01,178 put at the disposal of those very militarists who razed
a06-141-02,180 Coventry and barbarously bombed London and other British
a06-141-03,177 cities . FRANCE - One can hardly conceive the French are
a06-141-04,177 not alarmed ... . Next door , in West Germany , before everyone's
a06-141-05,178 eyes there has sprung up a regular army led by former Nazi
a06-141-06,179 generals and officers .
c03-096f-00,175 Only Mr. Lucas's actions , therefore , arose
c03-096f-01,173 explicably from appreciable motives . The
c03-096f-02,174 rest , one feels , were driven to effective
c03-096f-03,172 action by the author in spite of the
c03-096f-04,169 ineffectuality with which he had endowed
c03-096f-05,169 them . One hopes that he is not asking us
c03-096f-06,172 to believe that , because of their odd
c03-096f-07,173 accents , they act oddly like the queer
c03-096f-08,171 foreigners of tradition .
b06-032-00,182 All this has been achieved through Nato under
b06-032-01,182 American leadership . But a big role has been
b06-032-02,182 played not only by the British Government but
b06-032-03,182 by Right-Wing Labour in this country . They have
b06-032-04,182 helped build up Nato and rearm Western Germany ,
b06-032-05,182 in pursuit of the old familiar anti-Soviet
b06-032-06,182 policy which brought disaster in 1939 .
b01-122-00,162 It is impossible to make contact with Dr. Ver-
b01-122-01,162 woerd in his nightmare world . It is this that
b01-122-02,162 makes illusory any hopes that he may be in-
b01-122-03,162 fluenced to change course . The Archbishop of
b01-122-04,162 Capetown , Dr. Joost de Blank , has pleaded that
b01-122-05,162 South Africa should be allowed to stay in the
b01-122-06,172 Commonwealth . Otherwise , he says , those inside the
b01-122-07,172 country who still oppose apartheid will be
b01-122-08,152 left even more isolated and alone .

c06-020-03,182 a journalist , I write to entertain rather
c06-020-04,182 than educate . And I don't write at all
c06-020-05,182 unless I 'm exceedingly 2skint . " But I 'll
c06-020-06,182 say this . I 'd like to live in America
c06-020-07,182 and do some writing there .
a05-069-00,173 It was the end of a rather curious
a05-069-01,173 speech in which Mr. Macmillan wound up
a05-069-02,174 the two-day debate on foreign affairs .
a05-069-03,175 He began in a low , almost chatty mono-
a05-069-04,177 tone , and his voice never rose to any
a05-069-05,175 accent of urgency . He passed in rapid
a05-069-07,175 nuclear tests ; the canard about British
a05-069-08,176 interference with the United Nations
a05-069-09,173 in the Congo ; Kuwait ; and South-East
a05-069-10,174 Asia .
c03-096c-00,188 Only Mr. Lucas's actions , therefore , arose explicably
c03-096c-01,187 from appreciable motives . The rest , one feels , were
c03-096c-02,187 driven to effective action by the author in spite
c03-096c-03,187 of the ineffectuality with which he had
c03-096c-04,185 endowed them . One hopes that he is not
c03-096c-05,185 asking us to believe that , because of their odd
c03-096c-06,187 accents , they act oddly like the queer foreigners

e07-012-01,156 until it dies in the late autumn , the

e07-012-11,150 northwards .
c06-047-00,176 LESS has been heard of Brendan's work . It is now
c06-047-02,176 produced , three years since Borstal Boy was published
c06-047-03,177 and The Hostage was put on . What has happened to
c06-047-05,175 and due for presentation at the Theatre Royal ,
c06-047-06,176 Stratford , last spring ? It was never finished .
a01-049u-00,171 Senator Allen Ellender , of Louisiana ,
a01-049u-01,168 sparked off the opposition by telling a
a01-049u-02,170 television audience it was " current
a01-049u-03,170 Washington gossip " that Weaver once had
a01-049u-04,170 Communist affiliations . The Senate Banking
a01-049u-05,170 Committee , which is headed by another
a01-049u-06,171 Southern Senator - Willis Robertson , of
a01-049u-07,170 Virginia - met today in closed session to
a01-049u-09,169 Robertson later disclosed he had sent a letter
a01-049u-10,169 to Mr. Kennedy saying he had received
e01-081-00,156 First launder crochet and then pin to the required
e01-081-02,160 accurate . Place crochet in correct position on linen and
e01-081-03,160 secure with pins . Run a line of basting stitches
e01-081-04,159 on the linen following the outline of the crochet edges
e01-081-05,156 which are to be attached to the linen . Remove crochet .
c03-003f-00,173 This is not a filmed play . It has been concei-
c03-003f-01,172 ved throughout in terms of the cinema ,
c03-003f-02,173 and again and again it is the visual qualities
c03-003f-03,171 of the story , and the marriage of the
c03-003f-04,170 central characters to their background ,
c03-003f-05,171 which bring the film so vividly to life . In

b03-098-01,182 asked to help . To begin with , both tempe-
b03-098-02,182 ratures will be put in the ring together .
b03-098-03,184 SIR GRAHAM SUTTON , however , made no bones
b03-098-04,182 about it yesterday . The purpose is to give
b03-098-05,182 fahrenheit the knock out . The backers of
b03-098-06,182 centigrade would have got off to a better
b03-098-07,182 start if they had taken more pains to
b03-098-08,182 explain the advantages to the general
b03-098-09,182 public of the change .
c03-087b-00,154 It went , perhaps , some distance beyond most
c03-087b-01,154 treatments of its subject by attempting to
c03-087b-02,152 generate a melodramatic inevitability which
c03-087b-03,153 left its central character and the world
c03-087b-04,151 around him in complete , unredeemable desolation .

a06-000-02,187 The first hint of the Chancellor bowing to
a06-000-03,188 public opinion over his " July Budget " came
a06-000-04,185 dramatically in the Commons yesterday . Mr
a06-000-05,187 Lloyd said on # Tuesday that he proposed
a06-000-06,186 to deal in his next regular Budget with

e07-112-03,148 are usually more expensive than clay ones ,
e07-112-04,143 but they are almost indestructible and
e07-112-05,142 will last a long time with normal care .

b01-049-00,201 There they have stayed uselessly locked up because
b01-049-01,199 Germany has no tradition of trading abroad . In addition
b01-049-02,198 the strength of Germany's trading position has attracted
b01-049-03,199 speculators to hold marks rather than pounds or dollars ,
b01-049-05,197 WILL the new valuation be enough to correct
b01-049-07,197 off speculation against dollar and pound ?
a02-102-00,185 A ROYAL welcome for the Kabaka of
a02-102-01,184 Buganda ( King Freddie ) from Princess
a02-102-02,187 Elizabeth Bagaya of Toro , kneeling at the
a02-102-03,185 foot of his airliner's steps at London Airport
a02-102-04,184 yesterday . Forty other Africans greeted him ,
a02-102-05,183 kneeling with heads bowed . The princess ,
a02-102-07,183 dge , where she is a friend of Prince William
a02-102-08,181 of Gloucester .
a05-094-00,185 The trouble about such debates is that
a05-094-01,185 they range too widely . They remind one of
a05-094-02,184 the Rugby match in " Tom Brown's Schooldays , "
a05-094-03,184 in which all the boys were welcome to
a05-094-04,183 take part , and only those who " really meant
a05-094-05,181 business " removed their jackets . Not many
a05-094-06,181 metaphorical braces were visible in the
a05-094-08,182 Healey had another tilt at the Prime Minister's
a05-094-09,182 golf-course Press conference , which he
a05-094-10,181 described as " a display of flabby and
a04-092-00,182 There are three kinds of reasons that justify
a04-092-01,182 the protests and these should carry weight with
a04-092-02,182 the U.S. Government , Earl Russell suggested . " The
a04-092-03,182 first of these reasons is the importance of pre-
a04-092-04,182 serving the hitherto cordial relations between the
a04-092-05,182 U.S. and Great Britain , not only in Government
a04-092-06,182 circles , but in public opinion . " Earl Russell
a04-092-07,182 says it is inevitable , though profoundly
a04-092-08,182 regrettable , that the agitation against
a04-092-09,182 the Polaris base has generated some antagonism
a04-092-10,182 to the policy of the United States .
a01-000x-00,182 A MOVE to stop Mr. Gaitskell from nominating
a01-000x-01,181 any more Labour life Peers is to be made at a
a01-000x-02,181 meeting of Labour 0M Ps tomorrow . Mr. Michael
a01-000x-03,179 Foot has put down a resolution on the subject
a01-000x-04,173 and he is to be backed by Mr. Will Griffiths ,
a01-000x-05,173 0M P for Manchester Exchange .
a02-012-00,179 The team is composed of experienced
a02-012-01,180 negotiators in several fields . Sir Pier-
a02-012-02,177 son Dixon has a wide reputation as
a02-012-03,171 a skilful backstage negotiator since
a02-012-04,172 his days as Britain's chief UN dele-
a02-012-05,174 gate . Second in command is Mr.
a02-012-07,172 tary at the Ministry of Agriculture ,
a02-012-08,172 Food , and Fisheries . The Foreign Office
a02-012-09,175 is represented by Sir Roderick Barclay
f04-004-00,150 When he learned what was causing the commotion he
f04-004-01,149 became greatly alarmed , and after the body had been
f04-004-02,150 taken to St Thomas's Hospital it was his
f04-004-03,149 grief-stricken duty formally to identify Elizabeth
f04-004-04,146 Camp , aged thirty-three , the girl who was to have
f04-004-05,145 been his bride . There was little doubt of how
f04-004-06,146 she had met her death , and even less that it
f04-004-07,145 had been murder .
a05-062-00,176 With a vigour and authority which delighted
a05-062-02,176 the Earl of Avon , the former Sir Anthony
a05-062-05,169 that # appeasement over Berlin could
a05-062-06,169 only lead to war . To stand firm , he
a05-062-08,167 the surest way to avert it .
b05-074-00,186 They really believed that the Treaty of Versailles
b05-074-01,186 was an iniquitous injustice . When they burst into
b05-074-02,186 Czechoslovakia , Poland , Holland , Belgium and France
b05-074-03,186 they really believed Hitler when he screamed at
b05-074-04,186 them that they were being " encircled . " They really
b05-074-05,186 believed in the moral superiority of " The New
b05-074-06,189 Order " which Himmler on October 4 , 1943 , expressed
b05-074-07,186 thus : " Whether nations live in prosperity or starve
b05-074-08,186 to death like cattle interests me only in so far as we
b05-074-09,186 need them as slaves to # our Kultur ; otherwise
b05-074-10,186 it is of no interest to me .
a01-043-00,176 Informal talks at Lancaster House will
a01-043-01,176 resume today . President Kennedy today
a01-043-02,176 defended the appointment of a Negro as
a01-043-03,176 his Housing Minister . It has aroused
a01-043-04,176 strong opposition from the anti-Negro
a01-043-07,176 of his tasks will be to see there is no
a01-043-08,176 racial discrimination in Government
a01-043-09,176 and State housing projects .
c03-016d-00,166 But there is heart in the telling , and an
c03-016d-01,165 intense realism in the situation . A young
c03-016d-02,166 girl lives in a single dingy room with
c03-016d-03,165 her slatternly , promiscuous mother . In such
c03-016d-04,161 surroundings she learns sex is something
c03-016d-05,162 sordid , and when she experiences it for
c03-016d-06,164 the first time herself it is incoherently , clumsily ,
c03-016d-08,162 is the case in Fanny her first lover is a sailor
c03-016d-09,161 who leaves her to bear his child and sails
c03-016d-10,161 away .
a01-122u-00,167 " Mr. Powell finds it easier to take it out
a01-122u-01,171 of mothers , children and sick people than
a01-122u-02,169 to take on this vast industry , " Mr.
a01-122u-03,173 Brown commented icily . " Let us have a
a01-122u-04,170 full inquiry into the cost of drugs and
a01-122u-05,173 the pharmaceutical industry . " The health
a01-122u-06,172 of children today owed much to the welfare
a01-122u-07,174 food scheme . It was maintained during
a01-122u-08,171 the war . Now in conditions of Tory
a01-122u-09,171 affluence it seemed it could not be
a01-122u-10,173 carried on .
c06-100-00,186 So all ends as you know it will , with the
c06-100-01,182 middle-aged romancers respectably wed and
c06-100-03,182 Sandra Dee ( to whom , I believe , he is married
c06-100-04,182 in real life ) . Miss Dee , incidentally , who keeps
c06-100-05,182 turning up as the typical teenager in all the
c06-100-06,182 " good girl " parts ( Tuesday Weld gets the " bad girl "
c06-100-07,182 ones ) , is becoming quite an accomplished actress .
a01-053x-02,171 Government . Immediately Mr. Kennedy rushed a letter
a01-053x-03,169 to Senator Robertson saying the Federal Bureau
a01-053x-04,164 of Investigation had reported on Mr. Weaver .
a01-053x-05,174 He believed he would perform " outstanding
a01-053x-06,176 service " in his post . Senator Robertson's
a01-053x-07,165 committee has to pass Mr. Weaver's
a01-053x-08,168 nomination before it can be considered by the
a01-053x-09,174 full Senate .
e04-124-01,182 taking care to reinforce the sides of the dinghy at the seats
e04-124-02,181 with vertical members as shown in the plans . Make the
e04-124-04,183 before riveting on the gunwales so that you do not put
e04-124-06,179 one to fit the block .
c03-003c-00,186 This is not a filmed play . It has been con-
c03-003c-01,186 ceived throughout in terms of the cinema , and
c03-003c-02,186 again and again it is the visual qualities of
c03-003c-03,183 the story , and the marriage of the central
c03-003c-04,182 characters to their background , which bring the
c03-003c-05,183 film so vividly to life . In Fanny , which also
c03-003c-06,184 has its premiere tomorrow , the director , Mr.
c03-003c-07,184 Joshua Logan , attempted but failed to
c03-003c-08,181 create the atmosphere of a city .
g06-050l-00,186 Mauro's first action was to write to his revered
g06-050l-01,182 master at Ko"then , near Leipzig , asking for advice .
g06-050l-02,182 In doing so he described his distinguished patient and
g06-050l-03,182 his symptoms . He told Hahnemann that he found
g06-050l-04,182 Anglesey a strong , energetic man with a gentle and
g06-050l-05,182 charming character , even-tempered and sedate ,
g06-050l-07,186 ' but he appears to despair of ever being cured . '
a01-102-00,182 " After a lifetime of helping others and
a01-102-01,178 healing the sick , my considered
a01-102-05,182 are dealing with a noble edifice which
a01-102-06,178 needs an imaginative architect to
a01-102-07,182 improve it , but it has got a
a01-102-08,178 quantity surveyor . We have descended
a01-102-09,178 from the real problems to fiddling about
a01-102-10,179 with bills of cost .
c03-081e-00,184 Arguably , the dramatist has committed a
c03-081e-01,184 technical error in allowing Irene to speak
c03-081e-02,183 for herself ; we would be altogether clearer
c03-081e-03,180 in our minds about her if she remained
c03-081e-04,178 a flawed but beautiful enigma , seen but
c03-081e-05,179 not heard . However , Miss Pinkie Johnstone
c03-081e-06,181 makes her few brief scenes effective , and
c03-081e-07,182 Mr. Dinsdale Landen , in the longest and most
c03-081e-09,179 mance of rare intelligence and restrained
c03-081e-10,177 power .
g06-050h-01,191 at Ko"then , near Leipzig , asking for advice . In doing
g06-050h-02,191 so he described his distinguished patient and his
g06-050h-03,182 symptoms . He told Hahnemann that he found Anglesey
g06-050h-04,182 a strong , energetic man with a gentle and charming
g06-050h-05,182 character , even-tempered and sedate , not easily
g06-050h-06,182 irritated , patient and persevering , ' but he appears
g06-050h-07,182 to despair of ever being cured . '
g06-018b-00,162 When the sailing season was past , he sent
g06-018b-02,162 to Rome for the winter . In late
g06-018b-03,162 November , he was ' suffering as usual ' ,
g06-018b-05,162 this place agree with me better than
g06-018b-06,162 Naples . The journey has been against
g06-018b-07,162 me , as there has been much rain and
g06-018b-08,162 damp , but the temperature is high
g06-018b-09,162 & I have not yet thought of a fire ... .
c03-016e-00,180 But there is heart in the telling , and an
c03-016e-01,179 intense realism in the situation . A young
c03-016e-02,179 girl lives in a single dingy room with her
c03-016e-04,177 surroundings she learns sex is something
c03-016e-05,176 sordid , and when she experiences it for the
c03-016e-06,179 first time herself it is incoherently ,
c03-016e-07,180 clumsily , but half shyly and half in-
c03-016e-08,177 quisitively . As is the case in Fanny her
c03-016e-09,178 first lover is a sailor who leaves her to
c03-016e-10,180 bear his child and sails away .
r06-053-00,175 Some grim comic relief was provided by
r06-053-01,173 an elderly farm labourer out for a shoot
r06-053-02,172 who hid himself in a bush and imitated
r06-053-03,174 a blackbird . Unfortunately a sporting taxi-driver
r06-053-04,175 was after this very bird and shot the farm-
r06-053-05,172 labourer in the face . All , however ,
r06-053-07,172 pellets were easily removed and the
r06-053-08,170 labourer was able to return to work the
r06-053-09,171 same afternoon .
c04-017-00,179 But 6,000 miles seems a heck of a way to go
c04-017-01,178 for a new hit song . He might be well advised to
c04-017-02,179 think hard and long before his next jump into the
c04-017-03,177 Hollywood arena .
c04-017-04,174 VERDICT : Vaughan should have by-passed this approach .
c04-017-05,171 RONALD Lewis has just left for his first taste of the
c04-017-06,175 Hollywood treatment , thanks to a sound performance in
b03-092-00,152 Comprehensive legislation is obviously preferable . They should not ,
b03-092-01,152 however , disdain this opportunity of obtaining a useful sample of
b03-092-02,152 parliamentary opinion by at least allowing these Bills a fair run .
b03-092-03,152 Centigrade v. Fahrenheit . The fight is on . The challenger has behind
b03-092-04,152 it not only the authority of the SECRETARY of STATE for AIR
b03-092-05,152 but also the backing of the DIRECTOR GENERAL of the Meteoro-
b03-092-06,152 logical Office .
a01-132u-00,175 " That cannot continue without either development
a01-132u-01,179 being limited or an adjustment being made
a01-132u-02,178 in financing . " The Government decided to
a01-132u-03,177 adjust the financing - which Mr. Powell
a01-132u-04,175 claimed was underpinning - not undermining -
a01-132u-05,175 the service . Answering the attack on
a01-132u-06,172 " economic charges " for welfare foods , Mr.
a01-132u-07,175 Powell said that all these foods would
a01-132u-08,176 still be free in families receiving regular
a01-132u-09,174 National Assistance grants .
a06-128-00,191 Banks have paid in a first
a06-128-02,191 in response to the Budgette appeal .
a06-128-03,191 About another 70,000,000 is due
a06-128-04,186 by September 20 . For nearly a year
a06-128-05,186 about 150,000,000 has been frozen .
a06-128-06,186 MR. KRUSCHEV raises the bogy of
a06-128-07,186 German militarism in his replies to
a06-128-09,182 that the problem " must be solved
a06-128-10,186 this year . "
c03-003b-00,152 This is not a filmed play . It has been conceived
c03-003b-02,154 again it is the visual qualities of the story , and
c03-003b-03,151 the marriage of the central characters to their
c03-003b-04,149 background , which bring the film so vividly to life .
c03-003b-05,150 In Fanny , which also has its premiere tomorrow ,
c03-003b-06,153 the director , Mr. Joshua Logan , attempted but failed
c03-003b-07,151 to create the atmosphere of a city .
g04-014-00,165 There was a somewhat shocked atmosphere in
g04-014-01,166 some quarters , until I explained that my church
g04-014-02,168 was 800 feet high above the sea level ! The
g04-014-03,164 work was growing pretty heavy , and we managed
g04-014-04,159 to get a stipendiary layman who could help
g04-014-05,162 among the children and young people .
c03-003d-00,164 This is not a filmed play . It has been conceived
c03-003d-01,164 throughout in terms of the cinema , and again
c03-003d-02,164 and again it is the visual qualities of the
c03-003d-03,163 story , and the marriage of the central charac-
c03-003d-04,159 ters to their background , which bring the
c03-003d-05,161 film so vividly to life . In Fanny , which

a01-058u-00,166 PRESIDENT KENNEDY is ready to get tough
a01-058u-01,167 over West Germany's cash offer to help
a01-058u-02,167 America's balance of payments position . He
a01-058u-03,169 said bluntly in Washington yesterday that
a01-058u-04,167 the offer - 357million - was not good enough .
a01-058u-05,166 And he indicated that his Government
a01-058u-06,167 would try to get Germany to pay more . He
a01-058u-07,169 did not mention personal talks with Dr.
a01-058u-08,169 Adenauer , the West German Chancellor .
g06-042l-00,186 Nor is this to be wondered at , for even today , in the
g06-042l-02,186 As early as 1830 , when Anglesey believed himself to be
g06-042l-03,186 on the point of death , the new German curative method
g06-042l-04,186 known as homoeopathy had been brought to his notice .
e04-086-00,165 The chine is the long stringer on each side which
e04-086-03,166 ash , spruce or any long grained flexible wood . I
e04-086-04,164 prefer spruce when available . As will be seen
e04-086-06,165 on each side .
b04-181-00,182 There is no doubt what the Danes understand
b04-181-01,182 by free trade . It is that they should be free
b04-181-02,182 to sell as much as they like , while buying
b04-181-03,182 more and more from our rivals . Germany has
b04-181-04,182 now supplanted Britain as Denmark's
b04-181-05,182 principal supplier . The farmers of Britain
b04-181-06,182 understand free trade . That is why they fight
b04-181-07,182 it .
g06-037h-00,182 God grant , however , that I may be a false prophet
g06-037h-01,182 & that all may go well . Sir R. Peel was
g06-037h-02,182 here , I understand , but an express took him off
g06-037h-03,182 yesterday . '
g06-037h-04,182 While he was in Naples there had opened a new
g06-037h-05,182 chapter in the history of Anglesey's unceasing
g06-037h-06,182 search for an effective alleviation of his painful
g06-037h-07,182 malady . None of the numerous conventional
g06-037h-08,182 remedies to which he had been subjected ever
g06-037h-09,182 since the symptoms had first shown them-
g06-037h-10,182 selves seventeen years before had had the slightest effect .
g06-050j-00,182 Mauro's first action was to write to his revered
g06-050j-01,182 master at Ko"then , near Leipzig , asking for
g06-050j-02,182 advice . In doing so he described his distinguished
g06-050j-03,182 patient and his symptoms . He told Hahnemann
g06-050j-04,182 that he found Anglesey a strong , energetic
g06-050j-05,182 man with a gentle and charming character ,
g06-050j-06,182 even-tempered and sedate , not easily
g06-050j-07,182 irritated , patient and persevering , ' but
g06-050j-08,182 he appears to despair of ever being
g06-050j-09,182 cured . '
g04-104-00,151 In those early years 1914-18 , life was very full
g04-104-01,149 both in the parish and in the wider war activities .
g04-104-02,149 The Bishop , knowing that I spent my holidays in
g04-104-03,149 Bavaria , asked me if I would do something for two wards
g04-104-04,147 at the Royal Herbert Hospital , full of war prisoners .
g04-104-05,148 I was very glad to help in this way , and visited them
g04-104-06,148 frequently , establishing at once a friendly contact with
g04-104-07,147 the Bavarian wounded who were delighted to find
g04-104-08,148 someone who knew their native villages .
r02-109-00,176 Cecil gritted his teeth and glowered at the
r02-109-02,176 in tax-free champagne whilst he had to go
r02-109-03,176 easy on the immersion heater . ' What is it ,
r02-109-04,176 Cecil ? Don't you feel well ? ' his mother
r02-109-05,176 asked solicitously . ' You do look tired .
r02-109-06,176 Go and get yourself a drink . ' ' Don't
r02-109-07,176 fuss , mother ! I 'm quite well and no more
r02-109-08,176 tired than usual , and we finished the gin
r02-109-09,176 last week , you know that . '
g04-092-00,179 It was quite amusing to see how much
g04-092-02,181 of parents or faithful nurses threaten any
g04-092-08,179 it is a great joy to meet them now
g04-092-09,177 fifty years afterwards when so many
b06-012-00,176 His job is to build up the military apparatus which

g06-050a-02,182 In doing so he described his distinguished patient
g06-050a-03,182 and his symptoms . He told Hahnemann that he
g06-050a-04,182 found Anglesey a strong , energetic man with a
g06-050a-05,182 gentle and charming character , even-tempered
g06-050a-06,182 and sedate , not easily irritated , patient and

a04-000-00,172 PRESIDENT KENNEDY renewed his pressure
a04-000-01,172 on Mr. Harold Macmillan to join the
a04-000-02,172 Common Market during their talks at Admiralty
a04-000-03,172 House , Whitehall , yesterday . Much of their
a04-000-04,165 three hours , 20 minutes of discussion is believed
a04-000-05,165 to have been devoted to this main point
a04-000-06,172 of American policy .
g06-045k-01,166 the diplomatist Lord Ponsonby , had written to advise
g06-045k-02,166 Anglesey to give the system a trial , adding that it
g06-045k-03,166 was being cultivated with extraordinary success in
g06-045k-04,166 France and Italy , and that he himself was being
g06-045k-05,164 treated under a doctor who had studied under
g06-045k-06,164 its founder , the aged Dr. Samuel Hahnemann .
a06-114-00,178 If we joined the Common Market , our
a06-114-01,177 food subsidies would probably be
a06-114-02,176 replaced by a system of tariffs " That
a06-114-03,177 will mean a rise in the cost of living . "

a06-114-05,174 spending more as the summer holiday
a06-114-06,175 season moves into top gear .
a06-114-07,175 On the eve of August Bank Holiday
a06-114-08,176 the spending spree is at a new
a06-114-09,173 all-time peak .
b04-066-00,188 One more demonstration of the industry's recovery . As
b04-066-01,186 springtime approaches , orders pick up . And the car men get
b04-066-02,186 ready for another bustling season . The pessimists
b04-066-03,186 said the motor industry was on its knees . The optimists
b04-066-04,186 said " Nonsense . " As usual , the optimists have been
b04-066-05,186 proved right . EARL RUSSELL and his friends have
b04-066-06,189 hit on an original way of spending this afternoon .

b05-088-01,172 hectoring , out-of-date language , but in spite of all

c03-081c-00,188 Arguably , the dramatist has committed a technical
c03-081c-01,189 error in allowing Irene to speak for herself ;
c03-081c-02,187 we would be altogether clearer in our minds
c03-081c-03,187 about her if she remained a flawed but beautiful
c03-081c-04,185 enigma , seen but not heard . However , Miss Pinkie
c03-081c-05,186 Johnstone makes her few brief scenes effective , and

g06-042d-02,182 As early as 1830 , when Anglesey believed himself to be
g06-042d-03,182 on the point of death , the new German curative method
g06-042d-04,182 known as homoeopathy had been brought to his notice .
r06-022-00,186 This was strange , even magic , because the owner's
r06-022-01,184 name was Pierre Tortorolo which , in Nicoison Italian means
r06-022-02,184 ' turtledove ' . Pierre Turtledove . When we woke up properly it
r06-022-03,184 was raining , an even more hopeless rain than London , and we
r06-022-04,183 looked out of the windows at the weeping trees and the
r06-022-05,182 curling white breath of the mountains . The land looked
r06-022-06,182 like a beaten woman and the turtle-doves cried her
r06-022-07,179 shame .

c06-043-01,176 seizure and was gravely ill in
c06-043-02,176 hospital with a diabetic and heart
c06-043-03,178 condition . His return to Dublin was
c06-043-04,173 heralded by the announcement that

c06-043-07,172 heard of often in the newspapers -

h04-000-00,181 Nevertheless , average net family income
h04-000-01,181 was appreciably higher in families with

h04-000-05,177 and of course with lower tax reliefs and
h04-000-06,176 no family allowances . The rise in net family

f02-044-01,224 of Education for Glasgow , that industrial firms might be ready
f02-044-03,224 for retirement , their wages paid for the time thus spent . An

e01-050-00,179 During the sixteenth century a considerable
e01-050-01,180 amount of crochet was produced in the
e01-050-02,179 convents of Europe . Without doubt it was the
e01-050-03,180 nuns who carried the craft to Ireland . There it
e01-050-04,179 was developed into quite an elaborate and distinctive
e01-050-05,180 form with rosettes , leaves and lace fillings . During
e01-050-06,180 the time of Victoria this gentle craft was
e01-050-07,181 greatly abused .

c04-075-06,175 enough tacks and he got only the middle hammers done .
g06-011m-00,182 By the end of the month he still delighted in
g06-011m-01,182 Naples . He told Cloncurry that he enjoyed it as
g06-011m-02,182 much as his health permitted him to enjoy anything .
g06-011m-03,182 ' The Pearl ' , he wrote , ' is arrived , which is a great
g06-011m-04,182 resource . Vesuvius seems to be tired ; he is going
g06-011m-06,182 busy town . At Rome , every other man was a
g06-011m-07,162 priest : here the priest is 1superceded by the

c02-003-04,187 not only a director . He began his career
c02-003-05,186 as an actor , had his first important
c02-003-06,188 film ro*?5le in Ka"utner's " Die letzt

c02-030-05,155 and thoroughly frightening . Wicki has

r06-049-03,172 a few minutes later from a nearby village ,
r06-049-04,173 apologising for the trouble , but explaining
r06-049-05,174 that the walls were porous and the
r06-049-06,174 gas had escaped . General relief was
r06-049-07,171 expressed , but Monsieur V ( this was
r06-049-08,171 actually reported in the next issue ) returned

b05-098-02,172 impressed with this poem but , on re-
b05-098-03,172 flection , it might be that I took a
b05-098-04,172 guilty interest in the devilment busi-
b05-098-05,172 ness . I may well have felt that I was
b05-098-06,172 hell-bound under a strict Presbyterian
b05-098-07,172 upbringing and a possible reprieve might
b05-098-08,172 come through the sugary sentiments

g06-045c-01,182 the diplomatist Lord Ponsonby , had written to advise
g06-045c-02,182 Anglesey to give the system a trial , adding that

c02-082-04,179 in France and shown last autumn at
c02-082-05,181 the London Film Festival . In spite of
c02-082-06,182 magnificent performances from him and
c02-082-07,180 from Jeanne Moreau , this has been fairly
c02-082-08,180 well trounced by the critics wherever it
c02-082-09,182 has appeared . Leisurely , even slow ,

a02-020-00,188 Some of the problems were reviewed yesterday at a
a02-020-01,189 meeting in Paris between M. Couve de Murville , French
a02-020-02,187 Foreign Minister , and Mr. Heath . MR. Selwyn Lloyd -
a02-020-03,189 a man with troubles enough back home - seems
a02-020-04,189 fated to fly into trouble abroad . Last year it was
a02-020-05,188 the riots in Istanbul , which enlivened the NATO
a02-020-06,184 Council meeting .
e07-079-01,142 definite disadvantage . They are fairly heavy
e07-079-02,141 and difficult things to accommodate and
e07-079-03,142 they must have some protection from severe
e07-079-04,141 weather , which can be quite a headache in
e07-079-06,141 broken pots have on occasions provided
e07-079-07,142 artists with delightful studies , there is no
e07-079-08,143 doubt that a pile of badly stacked ,
e07-079-09,138 half-broken pots is an unlovely sight
e07-079-10,138 from any point of view .
g06-026a-00,182 A pleasant life truly ! ... It so happens that I
g06-026a-01,182 have an Italian who is perhaps the best Valet
g06-026a-02,182 de Chambre that ever was . But he has not
g06-026a-03,182 one word of English . ' While he was writing
g06-026a-05,182 temporary assumption of the government by
g06-026a-06,182 the Duke of Wellington .
b04-162-00,182 CONTRAST his firm , successful rule in Rhodesia
b04-162-01,172 with what has happened in the Congo . There
b04-162-02,182 Welensky's opponents have carried their theories
b04-162-03,172 into practice . There a UNO army of Africans ,
b04-162-04,172 bossed by an Indian , has been in charge for
b04-162-05,172 months . And what has it made of the Congo ?
b04-162-06,172 A bloodstained shambles . No wonder
b04-162-07,172 Welensky has lost all patience with his
b04-162-08,172 misguided tormentors .
g06-031d-00,182 ' What a frightful event ! ' he wrote . ' I tremble ! What
g06-031d-01,182 infatuation ! Personally I am indifferent , but I really
g06-031d-02,182 tremble for my country ! I may be mistaken , 1tho'
g06-031d-03,182 I cannot but fear that the exasperation of the People
g06-031d-05,162 that the Commons House upon a dissolution , which must
g06-031d-06,182 be had , will be a mass of Radicalism , & then God

c06-000-00,182 IT is mid-morning on a Dublin Sunday . The streets
c06-000-01,182 are tranquilly sunny and still , for the town
c06-000-02,182 is at Mass . Most of it . In the front room of
c06-000-03,182 a house in Anglesey-road is a congregation who
c06-000-04,182 never actually got to church , but who are
c06-000-05,182 gathered with devotion around Brendan Behan
c06-000-06,182 and a brandy bottle .
e07-072-00,159 DESPITE the steady influx of substitutes
e07-072-01,160 since the end of the war , clay pots are
e07-072-02,158 still in greatest demand . It is mostly
e07-072-03,158 in the smaller sizes that the substitutes
e07-072-04,157 have made headway , and although
e07-072-05,155 numerous small clay pots are used each
e07-072-06,156 year , they are fewer than they were 10
e07-072-08,156 no real substitute for clay that can be
e07-072-09,156 obtained at a comparable price , except the
e07-072-10,155 bituminized paper pots which are used on
e07-072-11,154 commercial nurseries for growing tomatoes
g06-045f-00,191 In April of that year his first wife's brother-in-law , the
g06-045f-01,186 diplomatist Lord Ponsonby , had written to advise Anglesey to give the
g06-045f-02,191 system a trial , adding that it was being cultivated with extraordinary
g06-045f-04,191 under a doctor who had studied under its founder , the aged Dr.
g06-045f-05,186 Samuel Hahnemann .
g06-050m-00,182 Mauro's first action was to write to his
g06-050m-02,182 for advice . In doing so he described his
g06-050m-04,182 told Hahnemann that he found Anglesey a
g06-050m-05,182 strong , energetic man with a gentle and
g06-050m-06,182 charming character , even-tempered and
g06-050m-07,182 sedate , not easily irritated , patient and
g06-050m-08,182 persevering , ' but he appears to despair
g06-050m-09,182 of ever being cured . '
e01-025-00,156 But lace-making is by no means a lost
e01-025-01,155 art . It suffered a decline and fell into
e01-025-02,155 lamentably low standards in the fussy
e01-025-03,155 over-furnishing of the Victorian age
e01-025-04,155 but it would take more than a temporary
e01-025-05,155 lapse in good taste to destroy this lovely ,
e01-025-06,156 viable craft . It has , in fact , readily
e01-025-07,155 adapted itself to modern tastes and the ill-
e01-025-08,156 ustrations in the following pages will show
e01-025-09,155 how completely it is in sympathy with con-
e01-025-10,155 temporary surroundings .

a04-031-00,186 RELAXED , smiling and clearly in the best of
a04-031-01,186 spirits , Mr. Krushchov yesterday returned to
a04-031-02,189 Moscow after his two days of talks with President
a04-031-03,188 Kennedy , writes Dennis Ogden from Moscow . The
a04-031-04,186 good beginning made at Vienna must be
a04-031-05,186 followed up by new efforts for peace , the
a04-031-06,188 Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda
a04-031-07,186 declared yesterday . Events in Vienna " gave hope
a04-031-08,188 to people of goodwill who hate the cold war ,
a04-031-09,186 and to all who are striving for a stable peace , "
b05-042-00,162 What happens is that the unskilled worker
b05-042-01,162 is processed , by high-speed listening to recorded
b05-042-02,162 instructions on how to do the job coupled with
b05-042-03,152 explanatory TV pictures , into becoming a highly
b05-042-04,152 skilled , obedient craftsman in no time at all .
b05-042-05,162 Not only can the raw human mind be
b05-042-06,152 technically equipped very quickly to do one
b05-042-07,152 set of skilled manufacturing processes in one
b05-042-08,152 trade but , by being given another of the new
g06-042b-00,163 Nor is this to be wondered at , for even
g06-042b-01,161 today , in the 1960s , no cure has been
g06-042b-02,161 found for the 6tic douloureux . As early
g06-042b-03,160 as 1830 , when Anglesey believed himself
g06-042b-04,160 to be on the point of death , the new
g06-042b-05,157 German curative method known as
g06-042b-06,158 homoeopathy had been brought to
g06-042b-07,159 his notice .
r06-011-00,184 We went in . There were a few people in the bar ,
r06-011-01,183 elderly , well-off , artistic , who , you felt , had made a hard
r06-011-02,184 bargain for giving up . ' I have furnished rooms , ' said
r06-011-05,181 We were shown around by Pierre .
g06-037l-00,186 God grant , however , that I may be a false prophet & that
g06-037l-01,182 all may go well . Sir R. Peel was here , I understand ,
g06-037l-02,186 but an express took him off yesterday . '
g06-037l-03,186 While he was in Naples there had opened a new chapter
g06-037l-05,182 an effective alleviation of his painful malady . None
g06-037l-06,182 of the numerous conventional remedies to which he had
g06-037l-07,186 been subjected ever since the symptoms had first
g06-037l-08,182 shown themselves seventeen years before had had the
g06-037l-09,182 slightest effect .
a01-091-00,182 The result of the vote was not in
a01-091-01,182 doubt . For the Tories were massed
a01-091-02,182 in answer to their whips to defeat a
a01-091-03,179 censure motion on the Government for
a01-091-04,182 " undermining the Health Service " and
a01-091-05,182 placing heavy burdens on those least
a01-091-06,182 able to bear them . Mr. Brown
a01-091-07,182 declared that the policy under censure
a01-091-08,179 was monstrous . It had offended many
a01-091-09,179 people far beyond the ranks of Labour
a01-091-10,178 supporters .
g06-011e-00,157 By the end of the month he still delighted in Naples .
g06-011e-01,156 He told Cloncurry that he enjoyed it as much as his
g06-011e-02,157 health permitted him to enjoy anything . ' The Pearl ' , he
g06-011e-03,158 wrote , ' is arrived , which is a great resource . Vesuvius
g06-011e-04,157 seems to be tired ; he is going out fast ... . What a gay ,
g06-011e-05,155 lively people , and what a busy town . At Rome , every
g06-011e-06,155 other man was a priest : here the priest is 1superceded by
g06-011e-07,156 the soldier - a favourable change in my eye , particularly
g06-011e-08,154 as the troops are very fine . '
g06-045m-00,182 In April of that year his first wife's
g06-045m-01,182 brother-in-law , the diplomatist Lord Ponsonby ,

e02-014-00,195 For short ones a smoothing plane can be used .
e02-014-01,195 The gauge can now be used to nick in the tapers
e02-014-02,195 on the newly planed surfaces , and these treated
e02-014-03,196 as before . It is unnecessary to mark the taper with
e02-014-05,191 of the plane sole to make the tapered surfaces
a01-122-01,161 children and sick people than to take on this vast
a01-122-02,161 industry , " Mr. Brown commented icily . " Let us have a
a01-122-03,161 full inquiry into the cost of drugs and the pharmaceutical
a01-122-04,161 industry . " The health of children today owed much
a01-122-05,161 to the welfare food scheme . It was maintained
a01-122-07,161 affluence it seemed it could not be carried on .
b05-071-00,189 He understood the whole apparatus with an exact and
b05-071-02,186 who used the system - and used it with power and authority .
b05-071-03,186 The appalling thing about the Germans is that they can kid them-
b05-071-04,182 selves and feel a sense of righteousness when their hands are
b05-071-05,182 red with blood .
g06-026e-00,162 A pleasant life truly ! ... It so happens that I have an Italian
g06-026e-01,162 who is perhaps the best Valet de Chambre that ever was .
g06-026e-02,162 But he has not one word of English . ' While he was
g06-026e-03,162 writing this letter he heard of the fall of the Whigs , and
g06-026e-04,162 the temporary assumption of the government by the
g06-026e-05,162 Duke of Wellington .
a06-134-00,178 The Notes to the Big Three and a memorandum to
a06-134-01,177 West Germany were published in Moscow yesterday . They
a06-134-02,178 tell : The U.S. - It is false to say the absence of a peace
a06-134-03,177 treaty with Germany causes no real danger . West Germany ,
a06-134-05,177 hotbed of war danger in Europe . Even now , aided by
a06-134-07,177 forces and arms to touch off a world war .
g06-018f-00,199 When the sailing season was past , he sent Pearl back to
g06-018f-01,197 England , and returned to Rome for the winter . In late November , he
g06-018f-02,198 was ' suffering as usual ' , but hoped , he told Arthur , ' to find this
g06-018f-03,198 place agree with me better than Naples . The journey has been against
g06-018f-04,200 me , as there has been much rain and damp , but the temperature

f04-011-00,147 The body was examined , and it was definitely
f04-011-01,148 established that no sexual assault had taken place .
f04-011-02,147 It seemed probable that the motive had been
f04-011-03,147 robbery , and this was further confirmed when a
f04-011-04,146 check was made with the woman's relations in
f04-011-05,145 Hounslow . Miss Camp had been the housekeeper at the
f04-011-06,145 Good Intent , a public-house in Walworth . Her day
f04-011-07,145 off was Thursday , and before coming up to London
f04-011-08,144 in the evening she had called on her two sisters ,
f04-011-09,144 one of whom lived at Hammersmith and the
b06-082-00,178 The statement of Padley and Crossman is no
b06-082-01,174 different in principle to the new defence statement .
b06-082-02,177 They accept American nuclear bases , and also
b06-082-03,176 the use of nuclear weapons and nuclear strategy
b06-082-04,174 until some future date . They deceive the people
b06-082-05,172 by their talk of political and collective control
b06-082-06,174 of Nato . The Pentagon has made it perfectly
b06-082-07,177 clear who controls the American H-bomb , and
b01-023-00,172 Seen in this wider picture , a South Africa that clings to
b01-023-01,172 apartheid is a menace to the Commonwealth and a
b01-023-02,182 liability to the whole Western world . A practical
b01-023-03,182 solution would be for the Commonwealth to draft
b01-023-04,182 a set of principles excluding race discrimination .
b01-023-05,172 And so leave South Africa to make the grade ,
b01-023-06,182 or go out .
r06-126-00,184 For his sake we chose the more
r06-126-01,186 serious of the two films that were
r06-126-02,184 showing in the little town . It was
r06-126-03,185 about a good priest who helped cri-
r06-126-04,185 minals in New York . His goodness , how-
r06-126-05,183 ever , was not enough to prevent one
r06-126-06,183 of them from being sent to the gas
r06-126-07,184 chamber ; and Philip and I waited with
r06-126-08,183 Catherine in the dark until she had stopped
r06-126-09,186 crying and could face the light of a golden
r06-126-10,185 evening .
e02-074-01,193 are many reasons . Wood is in good and
e02-074-02,190 common supply ; it lends itself to making
e02-074-03,191 innumerable useful household items -
e02-074-04,184 furniture , fitments , garden items , toys , etc. ;
e02-074-05,184 it enables results to be obtained fairly
e02-074-06,189 quickly ; it is less expensive than most
e02-074-07,189 other materials ; it is a pleasant material
e02-074-09,184 create a certain amount of mess , it is
e02-074-10,191 all clean and easily cleared away .
f02-003-00,193 A small panel was formed , not on a formally representative
f02-003-01,194 basis but rather of energetic and concerned individuals ,
f02-003-02,195 from various levels in the firm . In due course
f02-003-03,194 the panel decided to seek further insight into the
f02-003-04,190 problems faced by older workers , and approached
f02-003-05,190 those seventy years of age or older .
b06-064-00,174 Powerful units have stood firm .
b06-064-01,175 In unions where the central issues
b06-064-02,174 were confused , clear policy details -
b06-064-03,176 as on bases - were decisively carried .
b06-064-04,172 This , and the numbers of active
b06-064-05,171 workers who are beginning to understand
b06-064-06,169 how and why the trick was done ,
b06-064-07,174 provides a strong , immediate basis
b06-064-08,171 for a campaign against weak and
b06-064-09,171 doubtful positions , and for a consistent
b06-064-10,172 peace policy .
e04-043-00,163 Here are the plans of a very seaworthy little
e04-043-01,159 rowing dinghy many of which I have built and
e04-043-02,160 sold . It is especially designed for simplicity in
e04-043-03,160 construction , cheapness and lightness of weight ,
e04-043-04,157 and measures approximately 8 ft. by 4 ft. She
e04-043-05,156 weighs only 60 lb. but can carry three people
e04-043-06,157 and an outboard motor with a comfortable
e04-043-07,159 margin of freeboard .
c03-021b-00,153 In Fanny the pregnant girl is befriended by an old
c03-021b-02,152 women but yet moved by a strong maternal instinct to
c03-021b-04,149 who acts as a protector and comforter to her in her hour
c03-021b-05,152 of need . He shares her room and gives her his forlorn
c03-021b-06,151 gift of companionship and sympathy - " you need
c03-021b-07,149 someone to love you while you are looking for
a05-009-00,188 He has had numerous meetings with the Service
a05-009-01,188 Ministers . He has also had talks with the Earl
a05-009-02,188 of Home , Foreign Secretary , and with other
a05-009-03,189 Ministers concerned with overseas aspects
a05-009-04,189 of defence policy . Details of the scheme
a05-009-05,187 are now being worked out by the Chiefs
a05-009-06,186 of Staff , a process that may take four
a05-009-07,188 or five months .
e04-008-00,160 All the joints are simple halving joints glued and pinned ,
e04-008-01,155 which should nevertheless be cut with care to ensure a neat
e04-008-04,153 cut to fit them .
r06-076-00,176 They all had that neat look of
r06-076-01,174 Mediterranean people to whom nothing
r06-076-02,175 could ever happen , the chosen sane , the
r06-076-03,175 uncuckolded , unrobbed , sheltered from
r06-076-04,177 disease and accident by doctors , God and
r06-076-06,174 the bell would ring for them - the gilded
r06-076-07,177 love house , the mad grandmother or the
r06-076-08,173 bloody child at the crossroads .
g06-042h-01,186 the 1960s , no cure has been found for the
g06-042h-02,186 6tic douloureux . As early as 1830 , when
g06-042h-03,182 Anglesey believed himself to be on the
g06-042h-04,182 point of death , the new German curative
g06-042h-05,182 method known as homoeopathy had been
g06-042h-06,182 brought to his notice .
a01-113u-00,172 He told them that their conception of social
a01-113u-01,174 services was wholly different - fundamentally
a01-113u-02,176 different from that of Labour . They would
a01-113u-03,176 provide an ambulance service for the absolutely
a01-113u-04,174 wretched - but it would not be too comfortable
a01-113u-05,176 nor too easy to get . Answering jeers that
a01-113u-06,176 it was Labour which first put a ceiling
a01-113u-07,178 on health spending and started charges , Mr.
a01-113u-08,177 Brown reminded the hostile Government benches
a01-113u-09,179 that was done in 1950 because of the financial
a01-113u-10,178 strain of the Korean war .
e04-058-00,162 If you do not have a wooden floor on which to anchor
e04-058-01,161 the moulds , make a frame of rough lumber as shown in
e04-058-02,162 Fig. 2 . The main idea is to have the moulds standing as
e04-058-03,162 rigid as possible , for it is on these you will be building
e04-058-04,161 and shaping your little craft , upside-down . For cheapness
e04-058-05,160 I recommend using Douglas Fir Plywood from British
e04-058-06,158 Columbia .
c03-003a-00,184 This is not a filmed play . It has been
c03-003a-01,186 conceived throughout in terms of the cinema ,
c03-003a-02,184 and again and again it is the visual qualities
c03-003a-03,185 of the story , and the marriage of the central
c03-003a-05,184 the film so vividly to life . In Fanny , which
c03-003a-07,184 Mr. Joshua Logan , attempted but failed to create
c03-003a-08,183 the atmosphere of a city .
c02-078-00,172 It has a great look of speed and technical fun
c02-078-01,174 about it , of enormous cinematic enjoyment , and
c02-078-02,172 above all of cinematic sense . Much of it has
c02-078-03,166 that air of improvisation , as of off-the-cuff
c02-078-04,168 living , that once seemed so new and so
c02-078-05,173 attractive . The story ( not that the story , in the
c02-078-06,172 sense of plot , matters much ; but in the sense of
c02-078-09,172 who spends a few days with an American girl
g06-047i-00,162 This remarkable man of medicine , whom Sir Francis
g06-047i-01,162 Burdett described to Anglesey a year or two later as
g06-047i-02,162 ' more like a God upon earth than a human being ' , had
g06-047i-03,162 an increasing number of disciples among unorthodox
g06-047i-04,162 medical men in the cities of Europe . One of these
g06-047i-06,162 Anglesey consulted in May 1834 .
c03-096b-00,155 Only Mr. Lucas's actions , therefore , arose
c03-096b-02,155 rest , one feels , were driven to effective action
c03-096b-03,153 by the author in spite of the ineffectuality
c03-096b-04,151 with which he had endowed them . One hopes
c03-096b-05,151 that he is not asking us to believe that ,
c03-096b-06,153 because of their odd accents , they act oddly
c03-096b-07,154 like the queer foreigners of tradition .
a06-157-00,178 This figure has been surpassed only on the eve of the
a06-157-03,177 They will overflow and private houses will have to be used .
b06-079-00,182 It is impossible for Labour's new Defence state-
b06-079-01,182 ment to unite the movement as the Labour
b06-079-02,182 leaders are not only in favour of American
b06-079-03,182 bases , but are in favour of German bases and
b06-079-04,182 troops being trained on British soil . The new
b06-079-05,182 Defence statement , while accepting that Britain can-
b06-079-06,182 not remain an independent nuclear Power , now
b06-079-07,182 supports the policy of depending on American
b06-079-08,182 nuclear weapons and the H-bomb , placing
b06-079-09,182 Britain in an even more dangerous position .
c03-021f-00,172 In Fanny the pregnant girl is befriended
c03-021f-02,173 sexual , estranged from women but yet
c03-021f-03,170 moved by a strong maternal instinct to
c03-021f-04,169 the unborn child as much as to the
c03-021f-06,173 and comforter to her in her hour of need .
c03-021f-07,170 He shares her room and gives her his
c03-021f-08,170 forlorn gift of companionship and sympathy -
r02-003-00,182 He read the film star's sorry story and frowned at the
r02-003-01,182 provisions of Schedule D taxation which not only allowed her
r02-003-02,182 to claim relief on the most unlikely purchases , but also
r02-003-03,182 postponed demanding the tax until her financial year
r02-003-04,182 was ended , audited and agreed by the Inspector . The
r02-003-05,182 process could , and often did take several years .
a02-000-00,190 MR. Macmillan has picked a strong " brains trust "
a02-000-01,188 team to negotiate terms for joining the Common Market .
a02-000-02,189 And he has abandoned plans to visit President de
a02-000-03,190 Gaulle this month to smooth the way . General
a02-000-04,181 de Gaulle's official welcome last week
a02-000-05,180 to Britain's moves towards the Six was
a02-000-06,185 taken as a friendly gesture in Whitehall ,
a02-000-07,188 but no more than that .
a01-007x-00,174 Since 1958 , 13 Labour life Peers and #
a01-007x-01,175 Peeresses have been created . Most Labour sentiment
a01-007x-02,178 would still favour the abolition of the House
a01-007x-03,171 of Lords , but while it remains Labour has to
a01-007x-04,166 have an adequate number of members . THE
a01-007x-05,174 two rival African Nationalist Parties of Northern
a01-007x-06,178 Rhodesia have agreed to get together to face the
a01-007x-07,174 challenge from Sir Roy Welensky , the Federal Premier .

e04-022-01,174 keeping B flat on the chair seat , and mark
e04-022-02,173 off the exact position of B on the side
e04-022-03,173 pieces . These can then be cut at the correct

g06-018k-01,182 back to England , and returned to Rome for the
g06-018k-03,182 usual ' , but hoped , he told Arthur , ' to find this
g06-018k-04,182 place agree with me better than Naples . The
g06-018k-05,182 journey has been against me , as there has been

g06-011b-00,162 By the end of the month he still delighted
g06-011b-01,162 in Naples . He told Cloncurry that he
g06-011b-02,162 enjoyed it as much as his health
g06-011b-03,162 permitted him to enjoy anything . ' The Pearl ' ,
g06-011b-04,162 he wrote , ' is arrived , which is a great
g06-011b-05,162 resource . Vesuvius seems to be tired ; he
g06-011b-06,162 is going out fast ... . What a gay , lively
g06-011b-07,162 people , and what a busy town . At Rome ,

c03-007-00,142 In A Taste of Honey Mr. Richardson has taken
c03-007-01,141 a town in the industrial North of England
c03-007-02,141 and has made it live . The shabby streets
c03-007-03,140 and wet pavements , the school play-grounds ,
c03-007-04,135 the public monuments and the rubbish
c03-007-05,137 strewn canals - even the worn head-stones
c03-007-06,141 in the churchyard , " sacred to the memory of " -
a03-030-00,175 In some ways it will be a testing occasion
a03-030-02,175 unassailable simply because there is no one
a03-030-03,162 else in sight to supplant him . So the con-
a03-030-04,160 ference will concentrate on laying the
a03-030-05,160 foundations on which to win the next
a03-030-06,162 election . The rally comes at a time
a03-030-07,162 when in spite of carefully worded state-
a03-030-08,160 ments by the Prime Minister there is an
a03-030-09,160 air of electoral expectancy .
b05-083-00,199 In no other conquered country , not even
b05-083-01,199 Poland , had the Germans begun with such a
b05-083-02,199 drastic step . There is no doubt that the compatriots
b05-083-03,199 of Eichmann would have been as good as their
b05-083-04,199 evil word . THE Inland Revenue people have a
b05-083-05,186 thankless task . But they do not make
b05-083-06,189 themselves less disliked by their attitude
b05-083-07,199 to their customers - who incidentally
r03-056-00,191 " Yes , well ... . " He judged that she had been sufficiently
r03-056-01,199 dazzled and gave a long raucous cough . " Only
r03-056-02,203 cigarettes worth smoking , these . Most unhealthy , English
r03-056-03,224 ones . Well , now , let me see . I think I can put you onto

e07-094-00,149 Soil blocks are probably the oldest alternative to clay
e07-094-01,152 pots for plant raising . These are compressed blocks of
e07-094-02,151 compost , made in a specially devised press to
e07-094-03,153 simulate roughly the shape and size of a pot .
e07-094-04,150 Usually cylindrical or hexagonal in shape , they
e07-094-05,145 are made of the same compost as would have

g06-047f-00,182 This remarkable man of medicine , whom Sir Francis Burdett described
g06-047f-01,182 to Anglesey a year or two later as ' more like a God upon earth
g06-047f-02,186 than a human being ' , had an increasing number of disciples among
g06-047f-03,191 unorthodox medical men in the cities of Europe . One of these was
g06-047f-04,186 the Neapolitan , Dr Giuseppe Mauro , whom Anglesey consulted in
a01-049x-01,170 sparked off the opposition by telling a
a01-049x-02,171 television audience it was " current Washington
a01-049x-03,171 gossip " that Weaver once had Communist affilia-
a01-049x-04,163 tions . The Senate Banking Committee , which
a01-049x-05,165 is headed by another Southern Senator -
a01-049x-06,171 Willis Robertson , of Virginia - met today in
a01-049x-08,162 Senator Robertson later disclosed he had sent a
a01-049x-09,164 letter to Mr. Kennedy saying he had received several
a01-049x-10,171 complaints about Weaver's loyalty .
a02-024-00,190 Now we have the strikes and demonstrations in
a02-024-02,189 monwealth Economic Consultative Council - the
a02-024-03,191 first to be held in Africa . Only a few hours af-
a02-024-04,189 ter Mr Lloyd and his 24-strong delegation landed
a02-024-05,187 at Accra this morning , hundreds of shop assistants
a02-024-06,187 demonstrated outside the British-owned Kingsway
a02-024-07,187 Stores , the largest in town .

e04-099-01,174 plan measurements but leave sufficient margin for
e04-099-02,174 planing after fixing to the boat . Use your two
e04-099-03,173 lengths of 8 ft. by 4 ft. ply for this
e04-099-04,174 purpose , the sides from one , and the bottom from
e04-099-05,170 the other . If care is taken not to waste the
e04-099-06,170 ply , plenty of material is left over for the thwarts .
c04-028-00,169 Stepmother Ann Todd and doctor Christopher Lee are
c04-028-01,170 also effectively around . They provide some chilly red
c04-028-02,168 herrings in this " Find-the-body " thriller . VERDICT :
c04-028-04,169 NOT for the first time the homely mug of Sidney

c04-028-06,166 comedy . He does his rescue act in " Double Bunk "

g06-018j-03,182 as usual ' , but hoped , he told Arthur , ' to find
g06-018j-04,182 this place agree with me better than Naples .

c02-035-00,181 It is most unfair to call " Malachias " a cut-rate
c02-035-01,180 " Dolce Vita , " for it is far more intimate and deeply
c02-035-02,179 felt . In 1944 Herbert Selpin tried a similar feat

c02-035-05,178 and paid for his audacity with his life .

f01-066-05,141 word " soul " to stand for what many believe to be the imperishable
f01-066-07,140 the body , and to reserve the more prosaic word " mind " for

c03-007c-03,184 and wet pavements , the school play-grounds ,
c03-007c-05,181 canals - even the worn head-stones in the
c03-007c-06,184 churchyard , " sacred to the memory of "
c03-007c-07,184 - are seen as an integral part of the
c03-081d-00,151 Arguably , the dramatist has committed a
c03-081d-01,152 technical error in allowing Irene to speak
c03-081d-02,152 for herself ; we would be altogether clearer
c03-081d-03,151 in our minds about her if she remained
c03-081d-04,148 a flawed but beautiful enigma , seen but
c03-081d-05,150 not heard . However , Miss Pinkie Johnstone
c03-081d-06,152 makes her few brief scenes effective , and Mr.
c03-081d-07,155 Dinsdale Landen , in the longest and most
c03-081d-08,152 exacting role , that of the sergeant , gives
c03-081d-09,153 a performance of rare intelligence and
c03-081d-10,155 restrained power .
a01-026u-00,168 MR. IAIN MACLEOD , the Colonial Secretary ,
a01-026u-01,169 denied in the Commons last night that
a01-026u-02,170 there have been secret negotiations on
a01-026u-03,170 Northern Rhodesia's future . The Northern
a01-026u-04,171 Rhodesia conference in London has been
a01-026u-05,169 boycotted by the two main settlers' parties -
a01-026u-06,168 the United Federal Party and the Dominion
a01-026u-07,171 Party . But representatives of Sir Roy
a01-026u-08,168 Welensky , Prime Minister of the Central
a01-026u-09,170 African Federation , went to Chequers at
a01-026u-10,169 the week-end for talks with Mr. Macmillan .
f02-020-00,189 The weekend conference for the men and their wives ,
f02-020-01,189 which takes place at company expense in a country or
f02-020-02,189 resort hotel , includes an address on ' The Woman's Point
f02-020-03,189 of View ' and one on ' Making the Most of Health ' . Separate
f02-020-04,189 discussions are arranged for the wives in addition to the
f02-020-05,189 plenary sessions . Of the men reaching fifty years of age
f02-020-06,189 since the scheme started , 125 ( 37.2 per cent ) have
f02-020-07,189 taken part .
e07-101-00,152 One big advantage of soil blocks is an obvious
e07-101-01,152 one : the cost of a pot of any description is saved
e07-101-02,151 completely . Manufacturing the block and planting
e07-101-03,152 it is very little more trouble than normal potting ,
e07-101-04,148 and a superior plant , which transplants more
e07-101-05,141 easily , is produced . The obvious limitation #
e07-101-06,149 is that soil blocks can only be used for
e07-101-07,150 propagating ; there can be no progression to a
e07-101-08,148 larger block when the plant or seedling is ready
e07-101-09,148 to be moved ; it must be planted out or
e07-101-10,146 potted .
e01-032-00,171 The more delicate patterns and finer
e01-032-01,170 threads may be reserved to bring a light
e01-032-02,171 and lovely touch to personal possessions -
e01-032-03,173 a lace border to a handkerchief , fine-lace
e01-032-04,167 insertion on a petticoat or blouse , a tatted edge
e01-032-05,166 to a collar ; these add a charming , feminine
e01-032-06,166 distinction that nothing else can give .
e01-032-07,169 Although we assess lace-making as one of
e01-032-08,166 the feminine skills , a number of the well-loved
e01-032-09,167 traditional patterns that we follow today were ,
e01-032-10,168 in fact , the brain-children of inventive men .
c03-007a-00,186 In A Taste of Honey Mr. Richardson has
c03-007a-01,188 taken a town in the industrial North of England
c03-007a-02,189 and has made it live . The shabby streets and
c03-007a-03,186 wet pavements , the school play-grounds , the
c03-007a-04,184 public monuments and the rubbish strewn canals -
c03-007a-05,185 even the worn head-stones in the churchyard ,
c03-007a-06,188 " sacred to the memory of " - are seen as an
c03-007a-07,186 integral part of the story .
g06-042c-01,182 the 1960s , no cure has been found for the
g06-042c-02,182 6tic douloureux . As early as 1830 , when
g06-042c-03,182 Anglesey believed himself to be on the point of
g06-042c-04,182 death , the new German curative method known as
g06-042c-05,182 homoeopathy had been brought to his notice .
b06-093-00,182 This should strengthen the campaign to
b06-093-01,182 end the manufacture and use of
b06-093-02,182 nuclear weapons in Britain . Britain then
b06-093-03,182 could play a leading and independent
b06-093-04,182 role for an international agreement to ban
b06-093-05,182 all nuclear strategy and weapons of mass
b06-093-06,182 destruction , and lay the basis for real
b06-093-07,182 peace and progress . WHEN all the
b06-093-08,182 ballyhoo about Commonwealth Training
b06-093-09,182 Week subsides it is doubtful whether more
b06-093-10,182 than a handful of new apprenticeships
g06-050e-00,162 Mauro's first action was to write to his revered master at
g06-050e-01,162 Ko"then , near Leipzig , asking for advice . In doing so he
g06-050e-02,162 described his distinguished patient and his symptoms . He
g06-050e-03,162 told Hahnemann that he found Anglesey a strong , energetic
g06-050e-04,152 man with a gentle and charming character , even-tempered
g06-050e-05,152 and sedate , not easily irritated , patient and persevering ,
g06-050e-06,162 ' but he appears to despair of ever being cured . '
e02-025-00,179 Note that squared lines marking
e02-025-01,178 the top member of the toe are
e02-025-02,180 needed as well as the upper ex-
e02-025-03,180 tent of the taper , and in
e02-025-04,172 this case it is necessary to
e02-025-05,173 mark in the line of the taper
e02-025-06,178 with pencil and straight-edge
e02-025-08,171 made at the upper toe line

b04-004-00,182 In Ghana , President Nkrumah , who
b04-004-01,172 has done more than most to stir up
b04-004-02,172 trouble in the Congo , orders every Belgian
b04-004-03,172 citizen to quit his country . HOUNDING
b04-004-04,172 Belgium has become an international
b04-004-05,172 pastime . Why ? Because those who
b04-004-06,172 said the Congolese could govern themselves
b04-004-07,172 will not admit they were wrong . So
b04-004-08,172 Belgium , bowed down by internal
b04-004-09,172 troubles , mourning a terrible air crash ,
b04-004-10,172 is made their scapegoat .
b01-004-00,191 There is a possibility that it will not be
b01-004-01,191 settled at this conference . It may be agreed to
b01-004-02,191 wait until South Africa actually becomes a
b01-004-03,191 Republic later in the year . But if a final
b01-004-04,182 decision is to be faced now , on which side
b01-004-05,182 do the strongest arguments lie ? THE Archbishop
b01-004-06,182 of Capetown has shown that the matter is
b01-004-07,191 not clear-cut .

g06-018d-04,162 place agree with me better than Naples . The journey
g06-018d-05,162 has been against me , as there has been much rain and
g06-018d-06,162 damp , but the temperature is high & I have not yet
g06-018d-07,162 thought of a fire ... .
a02-067-00,174 They are required to show why they
a02-067-01,174 should not be bound over for disturbing
a02-067-02,172 the peace and for inciting a breach
a02-067-03,172 of the peace . The summonses say they
a02-067-04,170 are " likely to persevere in such unlawful
a02-067-05,170 conduct . " Lord Russell , 89 , was
a02-067-06,170 putting his affairs in order , and
a02-067-08,170 yesterday . His secretary , American-born
a02-067-09,171 Mr. Ralph Schoenman , said :

a01-128u-01,175 cheered for a full minute - and even his
a01-128u-02,174 bitterest opponents on defence joined in .
a01-128u-03,176 Mr. Powell devoted half his speech to giving
a01-128u-04,172 details of plans for improving the hospital
a01-128u-08,173 the proposed changes the net cost of the
a01-128u-09,175 service to the Exchequer will have increased
a01-128u-10,178 over three years by 20 per cent.
b06-053-00,181 For we have always felt , even
b06-053-01,184 if we have then by our practice
b06-053-02,184 ignored it , the inconsistency
b06-053-03,185 between support for the war
b06-053-05,184 spending on armaments , and our
b06-053-06,185 basic effort to improve living
b06-053-08,183 Gaitskellites using the position
b06-053-09,186 of organisational dominance
b06-053-10,183 established during their years
a04-039-00,186 In VIENNA , before flying off to Moscow ,
a04-039-01,186 Mr. Khrushchov said he hoped his weekend
a04-039-02,186 talks with President Kennedy would # help " to
a04-039-03,186 establish an enduring peace between nations . "
a04-039-04,186 Replying to a farewell speech from Austrian President
a04-039-05,182 Schaerf , the Soviet Premier thanked Austria for
a04-039-06,186 the hospitality and welcome he had received .
a04-039-07,182 " The Soviet Union has always striven and is
a04-039-08,182 striving to safeguard an enduring peace for
a04-039-09,182 the peoples , to secure an early solution of the
c04-023-00,172 He has earned his break . The film is a well-made
c04-023-01,173 variation on that sinister yarn in which half the cast
c04-023-02,172 try to persuade the heroine that she is out of her mind .
c04-023-03,170 Despite flagrant cheating the eerie atmosphere is
c04-023-04,171 built up neatly . Susan Strasberg is the crippled
c04-023-05,170 damsel in distress .
r06-090-00,189 It was growing cold . We left the
r06-090-01,189 crowd and drove back to Vence .
r06-090-02,190 The cool evening perfumes stood
r06-090-03,188 beckoning at the corners of the roads .
r06-090-04,189 Mart is unable to smell ( her sense
r06-090-05,188 organs were impaired years ago ) , and
r06-090-06,186 I had to explain the low , sharp and
r06-090-07,188 sweet signals in the air . When we
r06-090-08,189 got back home we felt exhausted .
r06-090-09,187 London sickness ( a sense of guilt ,
r06-090-10,187 mingled with the memory of sandwiches
g06-037f-00,203 God grant , however , that I may be a false prophet & that all
g06-037f-01,203 may go well . Sir R. Peel was here , I understand , but an express
g06-037f-02,203 took him off yesterday . '
g06-037f-03,203 While he was in Naples there had opened a new chapter in the
g06-037f-04,203 history of Anglesey's unceasing search for an effective alleviation of
g06-037f-05,191 his painful malady . None of the numerous conventional remedies to
g06-037f-06,203 which he had been subjected ever since the symptoms had first
g06-037f-07,203 shown themselves seventeen years before had had the slightest effect .
a01-063x-00,188 But he said discussions " on a higher
a01-063x-01,187 level than in the past " might be useful .

a01-063x-05,185 Washington next week . A big slice of

e04-079-03,148 a wooden floor you can use
e04-079-05,145 if not , use a strong horizontal
e04-079-07,147 the ground or concrete floor . I

c03-000d-00,165 The film version of Miss Shelagh Delaney's
c03-000d-01,165 play A Taste of Honey opens at the Leicester
c03-000d-02,164 Square Theatre tomorrow . It has been pro-
c03-000d-03,164 duced and directed by Mr. Tony Richardson ,
c03-000d-04,162 who is also part-author with Miss Delaney
c03-000d-05,162 of the script , and the great advantages to
c03-000d-06,164 be derived from this unity of conception and
c03-000d-07,162 control are everywhere apparent .
e04-103-00,171 Having trimmed up the chines , we are now ready
e04-103-01,174 to plank the sides . Start again at the bows ,
e04-103-03,175 round the frame to the stern and clamp there . If
e04-103-04,175 you have a third clamp use it in the centre as
e04-103-05,174 well . After generously covering with glue , screw
e04-103-06,178 the sides to the transom framing and the chine .
c06-111-00,190 This sort of situation calls for some subtle ,
c06-111-01,191 slightly sardonic handling . It doesn't get it . But
c06-111-02,190 The Marriage-Go-Round is not entirely a waste of
c06-111-03,191 time . I learned from it that in the Institutes of Advanced
c06-111-04,190 Studies attached to some American universities
c06-111-05,190 the subject Social Psychology used to be called
c06-111-06,189 Home-making and is now known as Domestic
c06-111-07,190 Relations .
e02-082-00,173 This last point is certainly important because almost
e02-082-02,171 are not only an economic necessity , but that a
e02-082-03,170 great deal of drudgery can be avoided by the
e02-082-06,172 ripping out parts from hardwood . Most men
e02-082-07,171 would unhesitatingly use a machine if it
b06-004-00,187 " Without Britain's tolerance German rearma-
b06-004-01,190 ment in the air would be jeopardised . " When
b06-004-02,189 Hoesch's reports , along with other nazi documents ,
b06-004-03,190 were captured and published after the war the
b06-004-04,188 pattern of British Government connivance became
b06-004-05,186 clear . At nazi Germany's request , Britain was
b06-004-06,187 providing the cloak for Germany to build an
b06-004-07,189 air force bigger than that of France .
b06-056-00,182 They obstructed every effort to fight for the
b06-056-01,182 Scarborough decisions , while # scratching
b06-056-02,182 around frantically to overturn them next
b06-056-03,182 time . Confusion of the original issue
b06-056-04,182 by misrepresentation of the decisions ,
b06-056-05,182 the introduction of a pseudo third way
b06-056-07,182 a demand that the movement unite
b06-056-08,182 with the Gaitskellites on their policy
b06-056-09,182 and no other seems to have done the
b06-056-10,182 trick of moving a number of unions
c03-007b-00,153 In A Taste of Honey Mr. Richardson has taken a
c03-007b-02,153 has made it live . The shabby streets and wet pavements ,
c03-007b-03,153 the school play-grounds , the public monuments and
c03-007b-04,151 the rubbish strewn canals - even the worn
c03-007b-05,152 head-stones in the churchyard , " sacred to the
c03-007b-06,154 memory of " - are seen as an integral part of
c03-007b-07,152 the story .
r02-010-00,182 Between all the interested parties , the final
r02-010-02,182 Miss Cheesecake to spend all the money which
r02-010-04,182 Discounting one chinchilla jacket , a Rolls-
r02-010-05,182 Royce and a Sussex manor house , all
r02-010-07,182 she now declared herself bankrupt .
a04-050-00,172 Mr Gaitskell said that a member of an alliance could
a04-050-01,172 not deny facilities to nations to which it was
a04-050-02,172 allied . But governments should be free to negotiate
a04-050-03,182 and refuse proposals with which they did not
a04-050-04,172 agree . The Labour Party opposed Thor missiles , because ,
a04-050-05,172 he said , they were out of date and vulnerable and
a04-050-06,172 would attract enemy action .
b02-105-00,190 But they were so convinced and they
b02-105-01,190 have had to take the consequences . Mean-
b02-105-02,189 while in Germany itself the course of
b02-105-03,190 the campaign has dismayed a good
b02-105-04,188 many people : they too will be glad
b02-105-05,183 when the polling stations close .
a03-089-00,171 This is expected eventually to replace the
a03-089-02,175 the backbone of the German Air
a03-089-03,172 Force .
b04-128-00,162 Top of the table , at the moment , is the chemical industry .
b04-128-01,162 Then comes engineering , followed by iron and steel .
b04-128-02,162 Even the staid and timid Treasury is cheered by the
b04-128-03,162 tremendous upsurge in investment . It reports that new
b04-128-04,162 factory building this year is likely to be 40 per cent
b04-128-05,162 up on 1960 . Britain's business men are right to back
b04-128-06,162 their faith with cash .
c03-087a-00,183 It went , perhaps , some distance beyond most
c03-087a-01,185 treatments of its subject by attempting to
c03-087a-02,186 generate a melodramatic inevitability which
c03-087a-03,186 left its central character and the world
c03-087a-04,183 around him in complete , unredeemable desolation .
c03-087a-05,184 We could , perhaps , say whether or not the attempt
c03-087a-06,185 succeeded if we had a little more faith in the
c03-087a-08,178 characters .
b06-045-00,173 For many years my union had to present its views
b06-045-01,175 to the two major conferences of the movement and
b06-045-02,174 take a licking . For us , unity meant accepting
b06-045-03,175 unpalatable majority decisions as binding on the
b06-045-04,175 movement and having a go next time . Alongside
b06-045-05,171 many others , we conducted our fight by putting
b06-045-06,174 down # unambiguous alternatives to
b06-045-07,174 official policy and seeking to win majorities
