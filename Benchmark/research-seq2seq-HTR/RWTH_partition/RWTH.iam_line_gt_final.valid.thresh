n02-000-00,177 DARKNESS had descended like a curtain by the
n02-000-01,176 time they docked at Belleray . And though Guy ,
n02-000-02,176 made nervous by Beryl's silence , drove at reckless
n02-000-03,177 speed to the Villa , it was quickly evident that
n02-000-04,176 the party was over . Piers came strolling out to
n02-000-05,174 meet the Deanes , and as soon as Guy had
n02-000-06,175 driven away , invited them casually to come to
n02-000-07,174 his flat for a drink .
n02-016-01,175 casual tone , " She 's not returning to her family . She 's
n02-016-02,172 going to live with friends of the bank manager , just
n02-016-03,175 this side of Belleray . " Mrs. Deane made a suitable
n02-016-04,172 comment , but Beryl said nothing . She was trying
n02-016-05,170 to sort things out in her mind . That beneath his
n02-016-06,173 unnaturally smooth exterior Piers was simmering
n02-016-07,174 with anger against her she had no doubt .
n04-015-00,171 A submariner's wife needed to be spared as much
n04-015-01,171 as possible . Anyway the Parsifal affair was far
n04-015-02,170 too fresh in both their minds to be a comfortable
n04-015-04,170 We can do with the extra money . It 'll just about
n04-015-05,169 pay Jacky's school fees . " " What shall we do
n04-015-06,170 about this house ? - and Jill's school ? - and oh !
n04-015-07,169 how I hate the Navy !
n04-022-00,170 If I 'd known what it would be like I 'd sooner
n04-022-02,170 work on Sundays , " he said . " They 're worse off than
n04-022-03,170 submariners . You ought to have married that fat
n04-022-04,171 stockbroker chap and shared him with his three
n04-022-05,168 mistresses . Anyway it might be much worse .
n04-022-06,170 Pericles is a Portsmouth boat . She spends longer
n04-022-07,172 in harbour than any other submarine .
n04-031-00,170 Practically a shore job . Cheer up . " She wiped
n04-031-01,169 her eyes and reached for her address book . " I 'll
n04-031-02,168 write to those agents and try to get a flat in
n04-031-03,169 Alverstoke , " she said . " But I don't know what
n04-031-05,167 blessing that Jacky 's off to boarding school .
n04-031-06,169 And all the trouble you 've taken with the
n04-031-07,167 garden !
n04-039-00,168 That little beast , Robbie Munyard ! " Having
n04-039-01,169 said her say Peggy manfully shouldered her
n04-039-03,171 another home . In the ten years of married life
n04-039-04,171 this had already happened half a dozen times .
n04-039-05,170 Such is the life of a naval officer's wife .
n04-044-00,183 John's father had been a naval officer of the old
n04-044-01,183 school ; some of his rigid ideas had been passed
n04-044-02,183 on to the second generation . One of these was that
n04-044-03,181 an officer should join a ship , on taking up a
n04-044-04,176 new appointment , at nine a.m. precisely , dressed
n04-044-05,180 in the modern equivalent of frock-coat and sword .
n04-044-06,183 It would have been acceptable to all concerned
n04-044-07,181 if John had stepped into Fort Blockhouse clad in
n04-044-08,180 plain-clothes on the previous night , but ways
n04-044-09,181 instilled by martinet parents have a habit of
m06-019-00,190 Though your wings and your scars are new ,
m06-019-01,189 you may join us . ' ' I am Lily-yo . We three
m06-019-02,190 are humans . You are only flymen . We will
m06-019-03,188 not join you . ' The Captives grunted in boredom .
m06-019-04,189 The Chief Captive spoke again . ' Always this
m06-019-05,189 talk from you of the Heavy World ! You have
m06-019-06,188 joined us . You are flymen , we are human . You
m06-019-07,188 know little , we know much . '
n06-148-00,195 I saw several men running down towards
n06-148-02,195 As the nearest of them came round the
n06-148-03,196 shack , his rifle at the ready , I saw it was Nick
n06-148-04,195 Dowd , still wearing his blue check shirt . He
n06-148-06,196 come 2a-calling , " I said . " Can't see no reason
n06-148-07,197 for calling , " he said . " Still long as you 're here
n06-148-08,193 you may as well stay a while .
n06-156-01,190 one of the miners who 'd come along with
n06-156-02,192 Nick Dowd took our horses off to water .
n06-156-03,193 We followed Nick Dowd into the shack .
n06-156-04,193 They 'd rigged up a stove of sorts and on it
n06-156-05,191 a huge blackened coffee-pot steamed . Other
n06-156-06,191 miners followed in at our heels . Nick Dowd
n06-156-07,192 found us a couple of boxes to sit on .
n06-163-00,194 A small man in bib overalls and a battered
n06-163-01,195 Derby hat fussed around the stove . " 2Ain't
n06-163-03,192 comforts , " said Dowd . He introduced the men
n06-163-04,193 who 'd come in as Roper Smith , Shorty , Mick
n06-163-06,192 the little hombre in big overalls . Very soon he
n06-163-07,191 had tin mugs filled with hot black coffee
n06-163-08,191 sweetened with molasses for all and for us
n06-169-02,192 as of now , apart from a few sacks of gold
n06-169-03,191 dust . " He winked at his partners . They all
n06-169-05,188 we 'd finished and I 'd rolled a cigarette
n06-169-07,188 you came in that 2somep'n happened last
n06-175-01,191 After you 'd left the meeting , mister " - I
n06-175-03,190 down William Appleton outside the Palace
n06-175-04,191 with a shotgun . " I paused and watched my
n06-175-05,188 words affect them in their different ways .
n06-175-07,189 " It 2jest about leaves everything wide open
n06-175-08,188 for Mr. Pell and his bunch , " observed
n06-175-09,188 Shorty .
n06-182-00,194 The rest of the men there said nothing but
n06-182-01,193 you could see they were hard hit . They were
n06-182-02,192 simple men who knew a lot maybe about
n06-182-03,194 digging for gold but were babes in arms
n06-182-04,193 when it came to dealing with owlhooters and
n06-182-05,192 desperadoes like Pell and Fenton and the
n06-182-06,192 rest . " I guess we 'd better hold onto the gold
n06-182-07,191 right 2hyar , Nick , " said the Sodbuster .
n06-186-01,191 better . " Surprisingly Dan Maffrey came in at
n06-186-03,189 sure asking for trouble . They 'll be on your
n06-186-04,191 necks before you can say ' knife ' . It wouldn't
n06-186-06,189 at gun point either . They 've done it before
n06-186-07,191 and got away with it . "
n06-194-00,190 " You 're 2durned tootin' , mister , " said the man
n06-194-01,190 called Roper Smith . " We 've got five rifles among
n06-194-02,189 us and a few six-shooters . But most of us
n06-194-03,190 2ain't 2eddicated in shootin' . It 'd be a
n06-194-05,191 on getting your gold to the bank , then we 'll
n06-201-01,190 with Dan Maffrey's aim to avenge himself
n06-201-02,191 on the Fenton bunch but still it was a
n06-201-03,192 handsome offer so I chimed in too . " That
n06-201-05,188 and hold up the stage , it 'll be a couple or
n06-201-06,186 three of them , no more . I reckon we can deal
n06-201-07,188 with them all right . "
m02-083-00,182 Peron entered , a large man , who had once been
m02-083-01,182 handsome but was now seedy-looking , a sufferer
m02-083-02,182 from stomach-ulcers . In the Back-Face tradition he
m02-083-03,182 wore , and kept on indoors , a fifty gallon hat . Harry was
m02-083-04,182 prepared for something unpleasant , for this was
m02-083-05,182 the Senator who had annoyed the United States
m02-083-06,182 by bragging how he had once won a trick from
m02-083-07,182 W.C.U. by threatening to loose off one of his
m02-083-08,182 rockets ( an admission which would scarcely help
m02-083-09,182 bluff to succeed the next time ) and , lately , by
p02-155-00,152 " I made it myself , " Gay tried to speak
p02-155-01,152 normally .
m01-090-00,194 After what seemed an undue period of repetition , the voice
m01-090-01,193 went on to describe the landing of the Thetan colony
m01-090-02,192 in Sussex , in all its obscene details . Then the radio
m01-090-03,192 went dead again , and Steve had no stomach for
m01-090-04,190 breakfast . It was a beautiful day , as firsts-of-June
m01-090-05,191 should be . Steve got out the car and traversed the
m01-090-06,188 same empty streets as he had the night before ,
m01-090-07,189 to keep an appointment with Heather .
m01-115-00,171 " Now , to summarize what I think our
m01-115-01,171 course of action should be . First , to avoid the
m01-115-02,170 Thetans like the plague , for they must not
m01-115-03,170 find us out ! Second , to tread pretty warily
m01-115-04,171 among our own people , finding out just how
m01-115-05,168 much freedom we can take with safety .
m01-115-06,166 And third , to study these damned Thetans .
m01-115-07,170 We must learn all we can about
m01-115-08,166 them .
d04-117-00,179 Leaning back carries the concealed message . And we
d04-117-03,176 were eating in Mitzrajim , to show they were willing to learn ;
d04-117-04,178 and we invite anybody who wishes to partake in our
d04-117-05,176 discussions , saying : " Anybody who is hungry , let him come
d04-117-06,180 and eat , Anybody who is thirsty , let him come and
d04-117-07,175 drink . "
d04-121-00,180 And we want all to eat and drink His Great Philosophy of the
d04-121-02,180 really interrogations to examine into the principles of the four re-
d04-121-05,179 questions is seeking the opinion of the one who is
d04-121-06,175 conducting the Seder .
m03-062-00,182 Small , repulsive creatures they were ,
m03-062-02,182 resemblance to the shrunk heads we had
m03-062-03,182 gazed at recently ; and I have no
m03-062-04,182 hesitation in saying that they would have
m03-062-05,182 made an end of us but for an intervention
m03-062-06,182 so unexpected , so unusual , that only the
m03-062-07,182 necessity of rounding my narrative
m03-062-08,182 compels me to mention it .
p02-131-00,182 Now let him go and you won't have to wait
p02-131-01,182 long for the right man for you to come
p02-131-02,182 along . If I was thirty years younger and weren't
p02-131-03,176 married to the sweetest wife in the world
p02-131-04,182 I 'd marry you myself . " Gay laughed , Doc was
p02-131-05,176 so kind and nice and she hoped that one
p02-131-06,176 day she would be able to see the situation
p02-131-07,176 as it obviously appeared to everyone else .
m02-075-00,169 Know how he did it ? He 's clever on
m02-075-01,168 the mouth-organ . So when he visited some
m02-075-02,167 craterlet on Face ( ours is an agricultural
m02-075-04,166 as soon as he had spoken a few
m02-075-05,164 sentences of his speech : ' Cut the
m02-075-06,169 politics , Lester , give us something on
m02-075-07,168 your mouth-organ . '
m02-106-00,182 But since starting salaries would depend on grade A
m02-106-01,182 or B in the finals next May , and since mating
m02-106-02,182 prospects would depend upon salaries , scholarship for
m02-106-03,182 these fine young people was closely geared to
m02-106-05,182 were really means . So , seeing them revolve in
m02-106-07,182 Moke consciously or unconsciously symbolised , any-
m02-106-08,182 way in Harry's mind ) had these splendid young
m02-106-09,182 people by the short hairs , and was diverting them ...
p03-121-01,182 at this time of year ? I can't ask you up because it 's
p03-121-03,182 don't keep hinting , then . You wish you could
p03-121-04,182 come with me ; you hope I 'll miss you ; you
p03-121-05,182 can't imagine the hospital without me for
m01-160-00,186 After a long wait a bus appeared and they
m01-160-01,183 followed the beaming Dan aboard , taking
m01-160-02,181 seats some rows behind him . Steve was
m01-160-03,184 beginning to find the stereotyped , flattish , happy
m01-160-04,183 faces very disconcerting ; and looking at
m01-160-05,178 Heather he found a welcome relief in her
m01-160-06,184 relatively long doleful one
f07-028b-00,152 When , however , the Greeks did learn the
f07-028b-01,151 art of making fireproof earthenware from
f07-028b-02,150 the Egyptians , their cookery made rapid
f07-028b-03,153 progress , because they were men of taste
f07-028b-04,150 and intellect . A remarkable peculiarity in
f07-028b-05,149 the banquets of the ancient world was the
f07-028b-06,149 fact that they did not confine the resources
f07-028b-07,147 of the table to the gratification of one
f07-028b-08,148 sense alone . Having exhausted their invention
f07-028b-09,147 in the preparation of stimulants for the
f07-028b-10,147 palate , they broke fresh ground and called
f07-028b-11,146 another sense to their aid .
f07-032b-00,150 By delicate application of odours and richly-
f07-032b-01,149 distilled perfumes , these refined voluptuaries
f07-032b-02,150 aroused the fainting appetite and added a
f07-032b-03,149 more exquisite and ethereal enjoyment to
f07-032b-04,148 the grosser pleasures of the board . The grati-
f07-032b-05,147 fication of the sense of smelling was a
f07-032b-06,145 subject of no little importance to the Romans .
f07-032b-07,146 They considered flowers as forming a very
f07-032b-09,145 and it is the opinion of Bassius that
f07-032b-11,146 far exceeded the number of fruits .
f07-036-00,150 When Nero supped in # his Golden House ,
f07-036-01,150 a mingled shower of flowers and odorous
f07-036-02,149 essences fell upon him ; and one of the
f07-036-03,150 recreations of Heliogabalus was to
f07-036-04,148 smother his courtiers with flowers . Nor was
f07-036-05,144 it entirely as an object of luxury that the
f07-036-06,148 ancients made use of flowers ; they were
f07-036-07,148 considered to possess sanative and
f07-036-08,144 medicinal qualities .
f07-039b-00,150 According to Pliny , and others , certain
f07-039b-01,150 herbs and flowers proved of sovereign
f07-039b-02,149 power in preventing the approaches of
f07-039b-03,152 ebriety , or , as Bassius less clearly
f07-039b-06,148 nothing new under the sun , but regarding
f07-039b-07,147 foodstuffs the traveller occasionally
f07-039b-08,146 encounters a certain measure of novelty .
f07-042b-00,152 In China , for instance , dried rats are
f07-042b-01,149 esteemed a delicacy . The visitor is told
f07-042b-02,150 that they restore the hair of the bald
f07-042b-03,151 and that a stewed black rat will ward
f07-042b-04,151 off a fever . A number of newly-born
f07-042b-05,148 white mice served alive , dipped in treacle
f07-042b-06,148 and swallowed like a prairie oyster is
f07-042b-07,150 considered a piece of resistance .
m04-145-00,193 But the jet aircraft was already miles away ,
m04-145-01,193 swinging down to the darkening earth . " It
m04-145-02,194 passed me at fifty thousand feet , sir . It was
m04-145-03,195 climbing steadily . " Group Captain Llewelyn Jones , Officer
m04-145-04,191 Commanding R.A.F. Station , Dinas , looked keenly at the
m04-145-05,193 Flying Officer who had burst so unceremoniously into his
m04-145-06,197 office . " And what did it look like , Broughtons ? Some
m04-145-07,195 sort of rocket ? "
m04-152-01,197 " Well , actually , sir , it looked like - like a bus .
m04-152-02,198 A single-decker , " he elaborated . Daggers , the
m04-152-03,198 Group Captain looked . " Broughtons , " he said silkily .
m04-152-04,195 " Didn't they teach you at Cranwell that buses are
m04-152-06,197 Buses crawl . " Very pale , Broughtons was . But
m04-164-01,196 Waving . " Like gimlets , the Station Commander's eyes .
m04-164-02,196 " Did you see the indicator board ? " " Yes , sir . " " And
m04-164-03,196 what did it say ? Mystery Tour ? " Oh , very caustic , that
m04-164-04,194 Group Captain . But Broughtons stood his ground . " No ,
m04-164-06,198 back in his chair . " I see . So you met a bus at
m04-164-07,192 fifty thousand feet .
m04-180-00,195 All lit up . Full of people waving as you went past . "
m04-180-01,195 Suddenly he crouched forward . " Broughtons , if I thought
m04-180-03,195 I 'd have you court-martialled . But I know there
m04-180-04,193 isn't , " he ended sadly . " I tried to read the
m04-180-05,192 registration number , sir . But it was getting dark . "
m04-180-06,195 He waited . But his commanding officer appeared to
m04-251-00,196 " Then we are saved , " cried the Rev. Edwards .
m04-251-01,195 Shyly , Morfydd Owen produced a block of
m04-251-02,196 chocolate .
g04-036-00,151 IN 1913 Dr. Burge , Bishop of Southwark , asked me to go as
g04-036-03,152 who was to become a very intimate friend , and I was
g04-036-05,149 solicitor cousin . As Bishop Talbot had told me that I
g04-036-06,150 ought not to spend many years in Tatsfield , we held
g04-036-07,152 great family consultations .
g04-039-00,152 My eldest brother was then living in Limpsfield with
g04-039-01,152 his family , and found a very suitable house nearby
g04-039-02,151 where my mother settled , and eventually died in 1926
g04-039-04,149 at the Institution and Induction Service in St. Mark's .
g04-039-05,150 This was taken by the Suffragan Bishop of Woolwich ,
g04-039-07,151 a close friend of ours .
g04-055-00,184 We also had a little Mission Hall leading off
g04-055-01,183 the Brighton Road , in a street full of small houses .
g04-055-02,180 This was called Ellen Avenue when I first went
g04-055-03,184 there , but was soon changed into the better-
g04-055-05,183 were lots of children there , and we had
g04-055-06,183 a flourishing Sunday School and an evening
g04-055-08,182 more help both at the church and Mission
g04-055-09,179 district .
m02-090-00,203 The motive would be the same in both cases , to
m02-090-01,203 serve this home of his , in which his heart lay .
m02-090-02,203 Here the rocket man's charm was disarming . Yet
m02-090-03,203 when the time came to leave , Harry felt as de-
m02-090-04,203 pressed as when he left Mrs. Halliday's office ,
m02-090-05,203 exactly a month ago . If even Mo statesmen only
m02-090-06,203 did what they had to do to get GO on an expan-
m02-090-07,203 ding scale , and left the sum-total of their actions ,
m02-090-08,203 and their lunar and earthly repercussions , to luck
d06-000-00,182 In the first place it is not a great deal
d06-000-01,182 of use telling even children , as I have
d06-000-02,186 already suggested , not to be silly or
d06-000-03,182 to pull themselves together . Far better
d06-000-04,182 to help them to face whatever it is that
d06-000-05,182 is worrying them , to find the original
d06-000-06,182 cause and then deal with it ; show it
d06-000-07,182 up either for the sham it is - and many
d06-000-08,182 fears are based upon completely
d06-000-09,182 irrational pre-conceived notions - or to
d06-091-00,179 There may be some who will argue that
d06-091-01,181 routine destroys the soul . It is so easy ,
d06-091-02,182 they say , to get into a rut . Save us
d06-091-03,179 from the school curriculum and even

d06-091-05,178 meals everybody knows beforehand
d06-091-06,179 exactly what , on any given day of the
d06-091-07,180 week , they are going to have . If - such
d06-091-08,180 a critic may say - you are calling

e06-006-00,180 The effect of bottom congestion due to
e06-006-01,180 the light pressure is inevitably mixed
e06-006-02,180 with that of the suitability of ground
e06-006-03,179 for spawning . Both result in crowding ,
e06-006-04,179 so there is no need to try to separate
e06-006-05,178 them - thank Heaven ! A good picture of
e06-006-06,180 this is seen on the 150 miles of spawning
e06-006-07,179 grounds from the Viking in the north down
e06-006-08,179 to the Klondykes and the Reef along

e06-037-00,179 The East Anglian behaviour ( see p. 82 )
e06-037-01,179 has always differed from that of the
e06-037-02,179 summer fisheries . There is the " swim "
e06-037-03,180 at slack waters , even in daylight
e06-037-04,181 sometimes ; and the high swimming ,
e06-037-05,180 when fish are caught only in the top
e06-037-06,179 few yards of netting . These and other
e06-037-07,180 fascinating behaviour mysteries are peculiar
e06-037-08,179 to this fishery , which unfortunately seems
e06-037-09,178 to be dying out ; but a full discussion of
e06-037-10,178 them is beyond the present scope .
e06-041-00,178 The Bow-wave Theory . This assumes
e06-041-01,179 that all fishing gear , when moving ,
e06-041-02,179 sends before it a kind of scaring effect ,
e06-041-03,180 probably through waves or vibrations in
e06-041-04,179 the water or along the ground .
e06-041-05,180 Underwater films suggest that the
e06-041-06,179 footrope of a trawl does this . Films
e06-041-07,181 have also shown plaice moving before
e06-041-08,181 a seine net in just the same way after
e06-041-09,180 being gathered inwards by the ropes .
d04-005-00,196 According to the legend , Solomon had asked the
d04-005-02,193 the Shamir and Ashmodeus told him that the
d04-005-03,195 Shamir had not been placed under his charge , as
d04-005-05,192 brought the Shamir to Solomon from Eden ,
d04-005-06,189 the Paradise , the only place where the Shamir
d04-005-07,189 could be found .
d04-008-00,196 The Talmud describes that the Shamir lives in
d04-008-01,201 a sanctuary , and only some rare birds know
d04-008-02,197 the existence of it . These birds are , the Cherubim
d04-008-03,199 and the Seraphim . We are also told that the Shamir
d04-008-04,199 is the stylus used by Moses , and this stylus is described
d04-008-05,198 as a very precious diamond-stone and very adamant .
d01-056-00,188 The most convenient one for the authors
d01-056-01,187 has been the text of A. Souter . In this
d01-056-02,188 version of the text the Fourth Gospel is
d01-056-03,189 printed as just over 1,000 different nouns ,
d01-056-04,186 verbs , and other parts of speech occurring
d01-056-06,184 forms . There are other texts which could
d01-056-07,188 have been used , and ( as shown in Table 1 )
d01-056-08,188 it is not a matter of the greatest importance
d01-056-09,183 which text is used .
d01-060-00,191 At first sight the difference between
d01-060-01,191 Souter and the other texts is rather
d01-060-02,190 large . But the British text includes
d01-060-03,188 the paragraph 7.53-8.11 , the Woman
d01-060-04,187 taken in Adultery , and this accounts
d01-060-05,189 for 178 words out of 279 , which is
d01-060-06,191 the difference between the 15,695 words
d01-060-07,189 of Souter's text and the 15,416 of Nestle's .
d01-060-08,188 The omission or inclusion of this paragraph
d01-060-09,189 is a matter of editorial decision rather
p03-009-02,198 man of the road his freedom of decision , and
p03-009-03,200 wishing life would sometimes allow serious-minded
p03-009-04,198 women doctors to blow a feather and follow its
p03-009-05,201 airy directions accordingly . " If I were needing a
p03-009-06,202 job I 'd go to London , of course , " she went on .
p03-151-02,182 that particular problem isn't looming at
p03-151-03,182 the moment , thank God ! " Problem ... ?
p03-151-04,162 looming ... ? " Are we discussing a marriage

d01-024-00,162 Most of those who expound a theory of textual
d01-024-01,162 dislocation take it for granted that the Gospel was
d01-024-02,162 written entirely by one author before the
d01-024-03,162 disturbance took place but a few leave it open
d01-024-04,162 to suppose that the original book had been
d01-024-05,162 revised even before the upheaval . The ingenuity
d01-024-06,162 of the theories is impressive and is the best

p03-069-01,203 realised it was important enough for her to have remembered , and it
p03-069-02,203 was as though a red mist veiled her usually clear sight and
p03-069-03,203 made her think there was an abyss immediately ahead .

f04-093-00,175 At Clapham Junction a ticket-collector
f04-093-01,177 was able to identify a photograph of the
f04-093-02,178 girl , and he said he had last seen her
f04-093-04,177 a train for the short run to Victoria .
f04-093-05,174 A passenger at Victoria said he had seen
f04-093-06,171 a young lady " as near as possible "
f04-093-07,176 like the photograph shown him , with
f04-093-08,173 a man " very close in conversation and
f04-093-09,174 walking arm in arm . "
f04-096-00,176 A guard reported that at East Croydon
f04-096-01,182 he had seen what was accepted as the
f04-096-02,178 same couple sitting close together in
f04-096-03,177 a first-class compartment of the
f04-096-04,174 train from London Bridge of which
f04-096-05,177 he was in charge . The two could
f04-096-06,177 have joined this train by taking
f04-096-07,176 one from Victoria and changing
f04-096-08,173 at East Croydon . He also believed
f04-096-09,173 that they had still been together at
f04-096-10,176 South Croydon , and he remembered
f04-100-00,169 Medical evidence established that Mary
f04-100-01,173 Money had been dead for about an
f04-100-02,174 hour before her body was discovered ,
f04-100-03,176 and this matched reasonably well with
f04-100-04,174 the timetable of the train in question .
f04-100-05,172 More important evidence came from a
f04-100-06,171 signalman at Purley Oaks , who had
f04-100-07,174 seen , as the train passed his box , a
f04-100-08,172 couple struggling in a first-class
f04-100-09,170 compartment ; but he seemed to have
f04-100-10,174 been used to seeing couples engaged in

n04-171-01,154 you a spin round one of these days , if you
n04-171-02,154 like . You could write it up . " Bawley made a face .
n04-171-03,155 " Not in Pericles , old man . " " Why not ? "
n04-171-04,149 " Better ask Robbie Munyard . " " What 's he been
n04-171-05,148 saying ? " John was furious . The little squirt !
n04-171-06,151 To go gassing to a newspaper man !
n04-183-00,155 " Look ! " he went on earnestly . " You 're not going
n04-183-01,155 to write up Pericles in some way or other , are
n04-183-02,155 you ? " " What is there to write up ? " said
n04-183-03,156 Bawley . " There are forty-three submarines in
n04-183-04,153 the Navy - why should I pick on Pericles ? "
n04-183-05,151 John eyed him steadily . " It 's the Parcifal
n04-183-06,153 business , isn't it ? " he said quietly .
n04-190-01,156 " more so than ever since I met you . "
n04-190-02,156 " What did Munyard say ? " " The Snort - hull
n04-190-03,156 fitting fractured . " " Supposing I was to tell you that
n04-190-04,156 we 've had Pericles' entire Snort equipment removed
n04-190-06,155 said John .
n04-195-00,157 " Munyard didn't tell me that . But I must confess
n04-195-01,153 I 'm relieved . But it still doesn't do away
n04-195-02,157 with the possibility of faulty design . " He held
n04-195-03,157 out his hand . " Maybe I will take a trip with you
n04-195-05,153 I 'll tell my editor that the story 's a dead bird .

p03-004-09,159 self as a stranger in these parts
p03-185-00,182 Thus had they parted the previous evening and now
p03-185-01,182 Diana was trailing up the gravelled drive to the hospital
p03-185-02,182 alone . Of course one couldn't say for certain when a
p03-185-03,182 doctor would be free during the day ; tea was served
p03-185-04,182 from four until five-thirty in the residents' common-
p03-185-05,182 room , which proved the elasticity of medical commitments .

d06-015-00,188 A little more honesty , even if one refrains from going into
d06-015-01,187 too many details , would help many a child to make a
d06-015-02,187 proper adjustment to life as it grows up . Let us look
d06-015-03,186 at Jesus . We do not , I think , see there a life without fear .

d06-030-00,186 Amen . MOST people would probably regard tiredness as a
d06-030-01,187 purely physical thing . The cure for which is sleep . This is only
d06-030-02,186 partly true . Many people wake up tired of a morning and no
d06-030-03,187 amount of rest seems to make any difference . Sleep , to be
d06-030-04,185 effective , must be of that child-like quality which comes
d06-050-00,187 Nor is she necessarily being deceitful . She really did feel tired
d06-050-01,186 until the mind got the necessary injection of a fresh - and an
d06-050-02,185 attractive - interest ! Tiredness has , therefore , as much to do
d06-050-03,186 with our mental state as with our physical exhaustion . A
d06-050-04,186 disturbed mind can bring the healthiest body to a sense
d06-050-05,184 of fatigue . They wonder why they get no rest at night ,
d06-050-06,184 even if they do sleep .

d06-082-04,184 be a little more orderly for we so frequently just muddle

m03-095-03,168 we were to go no further unless and
m03-095-04,167 until we were sent for , confirming
m03-095-05,167 another impression that became more
m03-095-06,167 and more definite , namely , that
m03-095-07,166 she was in touch with an invi-

p03-135-03,182 grimly , and tugged her fiercely into his arms . " You 're

e01-014-00,191 We know from the diaries of Samuel Pepys
e01-014-01,190 that he was a great man for lace - paying
e01-014-02,192 as much as 3 for a lace collar . But this
e01-014-03,192 didn't mean he was prepared to do as much
e01-014-04,190 for his lady , for he records testily : ' My wife
e01-014-05,190 and I fell out about my not being willing
e01-014-06,194 to have her gown laced . '

e01-018-04,191 among the effects left by Nell Gwyn is an
e01-018-05,187 unpaid bill for ' scarlet satin shoes with
e01-018-06,190 silver lace ' . The records of these tender trifles
e01-018-07,192 are very touching but then lace does place
e01-018-08,189 upon everything a delicate sentiment .

m04-190-03,168 remained empty . And so did the arms of Dai

m04-200-05,168 attitude . Now if there 'd been a good old accident ,

m04-209-01,168 things . You 'd be surprised , they said . So it
m04-209-02,164 seemed , for a time , that the whole affair would
m04-209-03,168 be written off as one of those unexplained
m04-209-04,164 mysteries , like the Marie Celeste . Then things
m04-209-05,164 began to happen ... But what about the voyagers ?
m04-209-06,168 you will be asking .
m04-216-00,164 Well , the Rev. Edwards had taken command . " Our
m04-216-01,164 position , " he said , " is somewhat analogous to
m04-216-02,164 that of a castaway on a desert island . Now
m04-216-03,168 what does such a person do ? He signals
m04-216-04,164 his position by lighting bonfires or hoisting a
m04-216-05,161 flag on a palm tree . And he tries to ensure
m04-216-06,161 a supply of food . "
m04-222-00,168 " Can't go lighting bonfires on this bus , "
m04-222-01,168 the conductor said firmly . " Contrary to the
m04-222-03,164 the minister . " No , we have another way of signalling
m04-222-04,164 our position . The driver must sound his horn
m04-222-05,164 continuously . " Gave him a look , the driver did .
m04-222-06,164 " Where you think we are ? " he asked rudely .
m04-222-07,168 " Dinas High Street ? "
n02-098-01,189 slowly , " If you must drag the truth
n02-098-02,189 out of me , I must ask you to regard
n02-098-03,189 it as confidential . " " My dear Beryl ,
n02-098-04,189 don't tell me anything , if you 'd rather
n02-098-05,189 not . " He was clearly startled by her
n02-098-07,191 not I , who started this conversation . "
p03-057-00,189 " Neither can Nigel , " smiled Diana .
p03-057-01,189 " He 's saving up to get married . Remember ? "
p03-057-02,189 " I remember , " quipped the houseman ,
p03-057-03,203 meaning no offence , " but does he ?
p03-057-04,203 That blonde was something . " " Anybody
p03-057-05,203 I know ? " she smiled . " I think so .
p03-057-08,182 " No , " Di said immediately . " It isn't at
p03-057-09,182 all important . "
p03-087-00,182 " Oh , he wasn't . His motor-bike had
p03-087-01,182 broken down outside and he noticed
p03-087-02,189 your car and then you dancing with
p03-087-03,186 this blonde . " " Really ? " Nigel cocked
p03-087-04,189 one eyebrow . " Actually she was brunette
p03-087-05,186 at the roots and I had a redhead on
p03-087-06,186 the other arm . He would have told
p03-087-07,189 you this , too ? " " No , " she laughed .
p03-087-08,186 " He didn't actually see you . Because
p03-087-09,189 it was your car I suppose he
p03-087-10,189 presumed it was you , all dressed up in
p03-096-00,182 " My white or my black ? " Nigel enquired .
p03-096-01,182 " Now I wonder which I wore at that
p03-096-02,182 particular surgery ? " " You are a fool ,
p03-096-03,182 darling , " Di said happily . " I shall take
p03-096-04,182 great pleasure in telling that young man
p03-096-05,182 exactly what you were doing that
p03-096-06,182 evening . " " No , don't , " he said , after
p03-096-07,182 kissing her again . " I rather like to have
p03-096-08,182 the housemen think of me as a
p03-096-09,182 two-timing Don Juan .
p03-103-00,182 I 'm such a dull fellow , really . " " Dull ? " She
p03-103-01,186 couldn't believe it . Self-deprecation
p03-103-02,189 was not one of Nigel's usual attributes .
p03-103-03,191 " You need your holiday , darling . I only
p03-103-04,203 wish I could go with you ! " " Doctor
p03-103-07,203 I suppose ? " she enquired archly .
p03-112-00,182 " No , it wouldn't ! " he almost snapped ,
p03-112-01,186 surprising her . " You sounded like some-
p03-112-02,186 body else for a moment there . It doesn't
p03-112-03,191 become you to behave like a - a tart , Di . "
p03-112-04,191 " Nigel - ! " she gasped . " I didn't mean to
p03-112-05,191 behave like anything of the kind . I
p03-112-07,203 miserable enough my having to take my
p03-112-08,203 leave in the autumn without you
p03-112-09,189 trying to be bright and gay about it .
n03-082-00,169 3" Blow like hell . Maybe by and by
n03-082-01,166 she blow some more . " " Hello , Willie , where
n03-082-02,167 did you come from ? " the judge said in
n03-082-03,166 mild surprise . " I didn't hear you . Do you
n03-082-04,165 see that fool boy of mine out there on
n03-082-05,163 the lake ? " 3" I see him . You don't need
n03-082-06,165 worry , Judge . Big wind like that can't
n03-082-07,166 drown good man .
n03-091-00,173 Bill is good man , and Bueno Buck is raised on lake .
n03-091-01,171 He no drown , too . Him , his mother throw him into
n03-091-02,171 water to make him swim when he is born .
n03-091-03,174 Maybe so Bill , he can swim that good , too . "
n03-091-04,171 The yawl , riding the high waves with an air that
n03-091-05,175 might have made an ocean liner envious , seemed
n03-091-06,173 prepared to make a safe though violent landing
n03-091-08,168 from the west .
g03-016-01,145 Guardian in March of that year , 1,000,000
g03-016-02,145 men were out a fortnight , disciplined and solid ,
g03-016-03,148 when only 20 per cent of them stood to gain
g03-016-04,146 anything from the strike and the other 80 per
g03-016-05,145 cent made sacrifices for their fellow men ;
g03-016-06,146 this remarkable strike raised the question of a
g03-016-07,148 living wage and showed the worth of the
d04-071-00,187 And we will nail the Divine Law on the
d04-071-01,187 door posts of the house and upon the gates .
d04-071-02,189 " That your days may be multiplied and the
d04-071-03,191 days of your children in the land , which
d04-071-04,188 the Lord swear unto your father to give them ,
d04-071-05,186 as days of HEAVEN ON EARTH " That
d04-071-07,190 ( Talmud Sanh. 99A ) .
d04-075-00,191 The Messusah , which is nailed on the doorposts
d04-075-01,190 contains those two lessons . The third lesson
d04-075-03,190 called " the going-out of the land of
d04-075-05,188 the " tsitsits " . This lesson used to be read
d04-075-06,186 only in the morning . And the Talmud tells a
d04-075-07,187 story , which is also in the Hagadah that
d04-075-08,186 Rabbi Eleasar ben Assarja said , " I am
d04-075-09,188 nearly seventy and I had not succeeded that
f04-046-00,156 Even the bone cuff-links found beside the body , which
f04-046-01,155 had at first been considered as belonging to the killer ,
f04-046-02,155 proved yet another red herring , for it was learned that
f04-046-03,155 they had been borrowed by Elizabeth Camp from one
f04-046-04,155 of her sisters . A young man from Reading named Marshall
f04-049-00,157 This man was known to have left his home on February 11 , and
f04-049-01,156 to have been away for four days . Not in itself a crime , but , added to
f04-049-02,156 the knowledge that he had gone shopping in the town of Guil-
f04-049-03,155 dford for a false moustache , it left him with something to
f04-049-05,153 join the Army ( presumably feeling that a moustache might enhance
f04-049-06,156 his military bearing ) , and this was accepted .
m04-000-00,177 NO ONE has ever satisfactorily explained how a
m04-000-03,174 too carefree , and becoming airborne ?
m04-000-04,173 Caught by a sudden gust of wind ? A
m04-000-05,171 combination of the two ? No one seems
m04-000-06,170 to know . But the fact remains that get
m04-000-07,168 itself into orbit it did .
m04-007-00,172 And a fine old fuss there was about it , too .
m04-007-02,173 the bus , the 2.20 from Dinas to Llangrwl ,
m04-007-04,172 Aboard , apart from the crew , were Mrs. Megan
m04-007-05,169 Thomas and her five-year-old son Cadwallader ;
m04-007-06,170 pretty little Morfydd Owen ; Mr. Stanley Hayball
m04-007-08,172 Birmingham ; Price the Provisions ; and the
m04-007-09,173 Rev. Edwards .
m04-012-00,171 Yes , the bus set out from Dinas . So much
m04-012-01,171 is established . Ifor Huw Evans , Propr. ,
m04-012-02,171 watched it go from the windows of the
m04-012-03,173 Dinas Motor Omnibus Co. Very interested ,
m04-012-04,170 Ifor was . For there was his garage hand ,
m04-012-05,173 Dai Pugh , taking a tearful farewell of
m04-012-06,172 Morfydd Owen . Morfydd , who had until
m04-012-07,173 recently been Ifor's typist , but was now
m04-012-08,171 returning to her home town as a
m04-012-09,173 fully-fledged schoolteacher .
m04-019-00,172 " But I 'm only going fifteen miles away , "
m04-019-01,171 Morfydd was saying . " Not the end of
m04-019-02,169 the world , is it ? " " For me it is , " Dai
m04-019-03,170 said wretchedly , wiping his hands on his
m04-019-04,173 overalls preparatory to a last embrace . " You
m04-019-05,171 will not be remembering a mere garage
m04-019-06,172 hand when you are lording it over
m04-019-07,173 the Mixed Infants of Llangrwl . "
m04-024-00,172 " Silly boy , " said Morfydd . Though she
m04-024-01,172 could not help wondering whether , now she
m04-024-02,176 had qualified as a schoolteacher , poor
m04-024-03,172 little Dai was quite the man for her .
m04-024-04,171 A nice boy of course . But perhaps in the
m04-024-05,171 new world she was entering there might
m04-024-06,171 be boys equally nice , and with far more
m04-024-07,170 to offer . The conductor rang his bell .
p02-127-00,176 Gay nodded . " I know that you 're right Doc , I think
p02-127-03,176 be the same , if you know what I mean . " " You sound
p02-127-05,176 I 'm glad you 're beginning to see that you 're wasting
p02-127-06,176 your time on that chap .
p03-142-01,182 make all the waiting worth while . When we 're
p03-142-02,182 married we won't have these explosions of emotion ,
p03-142-03,182 will we ? " " No , " he eyed her strangely . " I wish we
p03-142-04,182 were married , Di . Like a patient wishes his operation
p03-142-05,182 was over . " Again her laughter trilled . " Marriage
p03-142-06,182 isn't as bad as an operation , Nigel ! "
p03-158-01,203 your ring back . " She loosened the half-hoop of
p03-158-02,203 diamonds on her left hand third finger and held it
p03-158-03,203 out to him , still playfully . Without a glimmer
p03-158-04,191 of amusement in his own eyes , however , he took
p03-158-05,203 it , looking moodily beyond her . " Perhaps it 's as
p03-158-06,203 well if you don't wear it for a bit , Di , " he
p03-158-07,203 told her .
g01-083-00,145 A sum of 160,000 was demanded - a staggering figure
g01-083-01,144 to mediaeval eyes . It was determined that 100,000
g01-083-02,144 was a fairer target , and the Parliament agreed to find
g01-083-03,138 two-thirds of this sum providing the clergy supplied
g01-083-04,138 the remainder . The method of assessment to which the
g01-083-05,143 Commons agreed was that of the first poll-tax . The manifest
g01-083-06,141 injustice of this method had been to a certain degree
g01-083-07,138 corrected by the sliding scale of the second poll-tax ,
g01-083-08,138 but this lesson was ignored , and the injustice trebled in
g01-083-09,143 weight by a flat-rate tax at treble the rate - every adult
h01-004-00,147 The questions about children were the same as in 1951 ,
h01-004-01,146 except that they extended to all women who were or had
h01-004-02,147 been married . It was not regarded as practicable within
h01-004-03,145 the limits of the census to include particulars about
h01-004-04,141 the date of birth of each child , as had been done
h01-004-05,143 in the specialised enquiry for the Royal Commission .
g03-058-00,201 This new party , the British Socialist Party , was
g03-058-01,201 not prepared to accept the role of junior helper
g03-058-03,203 propaganda in order to increase the volume of
g03-058-04,199 socialist thought in the city , but sought to create
g03-058-05,199 in the Labour movement a more militant attitude
g03-058-06,203 capable of achieving socialism for the working
g03-058-07,193 people .
c04-156-00,172 It was a splendid interpretation of the
c04-156-01,175 part . The rest of the cast were well chosen ,
c04-156-02,175 with James Maxwell making a fine job of the
c04-156-03,177 sympathetic C O . Paul Daneman gave another
c04-156-04,173 first-class performance last night as a
c04-156-05,172 wartime naval officer in the B B C's
c04-156-06,170 " The Little Key . "
c04-160-00,171 The play was no more than a figment of
c04-160-01,173 the imagination which asked the viewer to
c04-160-02,174 believe in a beautiful ghost . It would have been
c04-160-04,172 production by Michael Hayes . He captured
c04-160-05,172 the atmosphere of fog and mystery to great
c04-160-06,171 effect . MORE than 100 viewers complained to
