I
have
a
hunch
that
he
will
feel
more
at
home
in
the
old
West
End
than
he
will
ever
feel
in
Hollywood
His
American
bosses
Fox
have
recently
given
Frankie
the
full
razzamataz
treatment
But
they
done
a
thing
for
his

career
that
Anna
Neagle
and
Herbert
Wilcox
were
not
doing
better
here
before
the
Hollywood
carrot
was
dangled
before
his
nose
But
is
by
no
means
a
lost
art
It
suffered
a
decline
and
fell
into
lamentably
low
standards
in
the
fussy
of
the
Victorian
age
but
it
would
take
more
than
a
temporary
lapse
in
good
taste
to
destroy
this
lovely
viable
craft
It
has
in
fact
readily
adapted
itself
to
modern
tastes
and
the
ustrations
in
the
following
pages
will
show
how
completely
it
is
in
sympathy
with
temporary

tramples

WEST
GERMANY
Russia
would
like
to
see
a
clear
that
West
Germany
would
not
survive
even
a
few
hours
of

third

war
The
best
way
to
rule
out
such
a
tragic
would
be
to
sign
a

It
was
the
end
of
a
rather
curious
speech
in
which
Macmillan
wound
up
the
debate
on
foreign

He
began
in
a
low
almost
chatty
tone
and
his
voice
never
rose
to
any

of

Much
of

THE

in

His
secretary
Ralph
Schoenman
said
What
a
frightful
event
he
wrote
I
tremble
What
Personally
I
am
but
I
really
tremble
for
my
country
I
may
be
mistaken
I
cannot
but
fear
that
the
of
the
People
will
be
so
great
at
the
upon
a
which
must
be
had
will
be
By
the
end
of
the
month
he
still
delighted
in
Naples
He
told
Cloncurry
that
he
enjoyed
it
as
much
as
his
health
permitted
him
to
enjoy
anything
The
Pearl
he
wrote
is
arrived
which
is
a
great
resource
Vesuvius
seems
to
be
tired
he
is
going
out
fast
What
a
gay
lively
people
and
what
a
busy
town
At
Rome
every
other
man
was
a
priest
here
the
priest
is
by
the
soldier
a
favourable
change
in
my
eye
as
the
troops
are
very
fine
True
he
did
tell
the
House
that
the
Government
had
asked
the
Medical
Research
Council
to
reassess
the
position
in
the
findings
would
be
published
He
was
not
so
happy
in
his
defence
of
the
failure
to
condemn
France
for
her
nuclear
tests
in
the
Sahara
on
the
grounds
that
they
were
only
little

Since

life
Peers
and

have
been
created
Most
Labour
sentiment
would
still
favour
the

Macmillan
explained
that
he
had
ately
refrained
during
the
summer
from
recalling
Parliament
or
ordering
by
such
as
would
be
on
to
a
fully
active
footing
That
would
have
created
a
thoroughly
sirable
atmosphere
of
panic

thought
that
the
situation
was
rather
more
hopeful
That

continue

either

decided
to
adjust

Powell
claimed
was
not
the
service

the
attack

said

had
an
increasing
number
of

One
of
these
was
the
Neapolitan
Dr
Giuseppe

Anglesey
consulted
in

They
obstructed
every

Macleod
went
on
with
the
conference
at
Lancaster
House
despite
the
crisis
which
had
blown
up
He
has
now
revealed
his
full
plans
to
the
Africans
and
Liberals
attending
These
plans
do
not
give
the
Africans
the
overall
rity

are
seeking

delegates

studying
them
today
The
conference
will
meet
to
discuss
the

of

proposed
House
of
Chiefs
When
carried
our
point
of
view
we
were
naturally
delighted
more
so
because
the
had
been
put
clearly
to
the
movement
which
had
then
chosen
a
vigorous
and
rearmament
policy
Hopes
rose
as
we
saw
a
of
sharp
struggle
based
on
consistent
lines
of
difference
with
the
Tories
Many
members
understood
that
the
struggles
of
the
union
would
become
easier
in
the
context
I
could
at
once
notice
the
great
antagonism
between
the
Bavarians
and
the
Prussians
who
openly
scorned
these
more
simple
country
folk
ponder
how
their
gardening
tools
are
returned
to

their
books
tidied

often
even
their

How
wonderful
if

There
was
a
somewhat
shocked
atmosphere
in
some
quarters
until
I
explained
that
my
church
was
feet
high
above
the
sea
level
The
work
was
growing
pretty
heavy
and
we
managed
to
get
a
layman
who
could
help
among
the
children
and
young
people
He
understood
the
whole
apparatus
with
an
exact
and
who
used
the
system
and
used
it
with
power
and
authority
The
appalling
thing
about
the
Germans
is
that
they
can
kid
selves
and
feel
a
sense
of
when
their
hands
are
red
with
blood
But
at
the
same
time
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
Federal
Government
is
not
convinced
on
the
basis
of
the
it
has
so
far
that
such
a
project
would
and
not
merely
constitute
a
prestige
satellite
to
some
extent
American
efforts
as
Die

suggests

forms
of

damage
payment
made
by
the
Commission
are
highway
payments
clearance
payments
for
clearing
remains
of
structures
from
total
loss
sites
and
church
payments
Although
differing
in
certain
important
ways
from
the
ordinary
cost
of
works
payments
the
sums
paid
under
these
heads
have
the
common
feature
that
they
are
all
payments
in
respect
of
works
which
have
been
carried
out

have
also
included

able

declared
that

was
monstrous
It
had
offended
many
people

beyond

ranks
of
Labour
supporters
first
action
was
to
write
to
his
revered
master
at

In
doing
so
he
described
his

and
his

told

reflected
not

an

Sir

was
here
I
understand
but
an
express
took
him
off
yesterday

in

had
opened
a
new
chapter
in
the
history
of
unceasing
search
for
an
effective
of
his
painful
malady
None
of
the
numerous
remedies
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
ever
since
the
symptoms
had
first
shown
themselves
seventeen
years
before
had
had
the
slightest
effect

In
April
of
that
year
his
first
the
Lord
Ponsonby
had
written
to
advise
Anglesey
to
give
the
system
a
trial
adding
that
it
was
being
cultivated
with
success
in
France
and
Italy
and
that
he
himself
was
being
treated
under
a
doctor
who
had
studied
under
its
founder
the
aged
Samuel
Hahnemann
By
the
end
of

still
delighted

children

this
vast

Brown
commented
icily
Let
us
have
a
full
inquiry
into
the
cost
of
drugs
and
the
industry
The
health
of
children
today
owed
much
to
the
welfare
food
scheme
It
was
maintained
affluence
it
seemed
it
could
not
be
carried
on
There
are
three
kinds
of
reasons
that
justify
the
protests
and
these
should
carry
weight
with
the
Government
Earl
Russell
suggested
The
first
of
these
reasons
is
the
importance
of
serving
the
hitherto
cordial
relations
between
the
and
Great
Britain
not
only
in
Government
circles
but
in
public
opinion
Earl
Russell
says
it
is
inevitable
though
profoundly
that
the
agitation
against
the
Polaris
base
has
generated
some
antagonism
to
the
policy
of
the
United
States
BEFORE
the
war
he
urged
the
British
people
to
welcome
troops
as
tourists
After
the
war
he
favoured
a
preventive
war
against
Russia
Now
he
wants
Britain
to
demolish
her
defences
Throughout
the
years
Lord
Russell
and
his
supporters
have
been
able
to
pursue
their
eccentric
campaigns
in
freedom
They
should
ask
themselves
this
question
How
long
would
that
freedom
last
if
their
policies
were
adopted
Following
Bruce
original
novel
with
fidelity
the
film
tells
the
story
of
a
little
monk
who
prays
that
a
table

club
near
his
church
be
moved
One
night

prayer
is
answered

is

is

to

For

The
third
reason
is
that
the
supreme
interest
for
the
whole
world
East
and
West
and
nations
is
the
prevention
of
nuclear
war
A
rapidly
growing
body
of
opinion
in
this
country
believes
that
Britain
could
be
more
effective
in
preventing
a
nuclear
war
as
a
neutral
by
helping
to
suggest
agreements
which
could
be
accepted
by
both
East
and
West
The
evil
that
Byron

after
him

outmatched

mischief

had

to
him
In
turning
over
the
bones
Doris
Langley
Moore
has
brought
to
light
a
great
deal
of
behaviour
and
a
vision
of
making
of
the
leisured
classes
in
the
early
century
which
leaves
one
a
little
breathless

cause

glorious
one
Good
health

Nor
is
this
to
be
wondered
at
for
even
today

the
no
cure
has
been
found
for
the
douloureux
As
early
as
when
Anglesey
believed
himself
to
be
on
the
point
of
death
the
new
German
curative
method
known
as
had
been
brought
to
his
notice
He
has
earned
his
break
The
film
is
a
variation
on
that
sinister
yarn
in
which
half
the
cast
try
to
persuade
the
heroine
that
she
is
out
of
her
mind
Despite
flagrant
cheating
the
eerie
atmosphere
is
built

now
to
the
actual
tools
and
their
cost
we
begin
with
what
we
have
called
a
bare
minimum
kit
Probably
most
men
have
some
of
the
tools
already
It
will
enable
a
man
to
make
simple
things
and
in
any
case
may
be
regarded
as
a
good
beginning
to
which
other
tools
can
be
added
as
the
need
arises
The
nature
of
the
work
will
probably
dictate
the
additions
to
be
made
but
as
a
guide
we
have
given
a
fuller
kit
which
increases
the
range
of
things
that
can
be
made
enormously
By
the

of

still
delighted
in
Naples
He
told
Cloncurry
that
he
enjoyed
it

his
health
permitted
him

most

seem
disposed

face
The
real
question
is
Government
as
a
basis
for
talks
and
first
action
was
to
write
to
his
revered
master
at
near
Leipzig
asking
for
advice
In
doing
so
he
described
his
patient
and
his

told

he
found
Anglesey
a
strong
energetic
man
with
a
gentle

This
apparently
was
assessment
He
confined
his
reply
to
the
that
Fell
had
probably
maximised
his
support
There
were
no
other
attacks
of
such
ferocity

It
was
while
I
was
at
Tatsfield
that
I
first
visited
in
Bavaria
to
witness
the
Passion
Play
The
place
and
its
people
were
to
play
an
important
part
in
my
life
For
five
years
in
succession
till

broke
out
in
I
spent
my
summer
holidays
there
and
became
very
intimate
with
the
people
and
the
environs
Every
year
between
the
Passion
Plays
an
interval
of
ten
years
another

would
be
performed

what
the
Russians

But
he
was
certain
that
they
wanted
to

division
of

Britain
could
not
be

to
an
imposed

Many
amateur
gardeners
might
improve
their
results
by
buying
a
small
soil
block
maker
and
use
the
money
saved
on
buying
small
pots
to
improve
their
composts
The
various
types
of
small

pots
are
very
useful
for
operations
but
are
inclined
to
collapse
if
the

are

To

been
a

weighing
down

almost
paralysing
their

of

crisis
It

not

reasonably
clear
with

has

there

For
in
the

this

But
a
big
role
has
been
played
not

by

Government
but
by

They
have
helped
build
up
Nato
and
rearm
Western
Germany
in
pursuit
of
the
old
familiar
policy
which
brought

by

one
of

took
our

off

We
followed
Nick
Dowd
into

They
rigged
up
a

of

on

a

from

winked
at
his

all
we
finished

Shorty
The
rest
of
the
men
there
said
nothing
but
you
could
see
they
were
hard
hit
They
were
simple
men
who
knew
a
lot
maybe
about
digging
for
gold
but
were
babes
in
arms
when
it
came
to
dealing
with
owlhooters
and
like
Pell
and
Fenton
and
the
rest
I
guess
we
better
hold
onto
the

right

we
with

still
it
was
a

I
chimed
in

bragging
how
he
had
once

with
Heather
Now
to
summarize
what
I
think
our
course
of
action
should
be
First
to
avoid
the
Thetans
like
the
plague
for
they
must
not
find
us
out
Second
to
tread
pretty
warily
among
our
own
people
finding
out
just
how
much
freedom
we
can
take
with
safety
And
third
to
study
these
damned
Thetans
We
must
learn
all
we
can
about
them
Leaning
back
carries
the
concealed
message
And
we
were
eating
in
Mitzrajim
to
show
they
were
willing
to
learn
and
we
invite
anybody
who
wishes
to
partake
in
our
saying
Anybody
who
is
hungry
let
him
come
and
eat
Anybody
who
is
thirsty
let
him
come
and
drink
And
we
want
all
to
eat
and
drink
His
Great
Philosophy
of
the
really
to
examine
into
the
principles
of
the
four
questions
is
seeking
the
opinion
of
the
one
who
is
conducting
the
Seder
Small
repulsive
creatures
they
were
to
the
shrunk
heads
we
had
gazed
at
recently
and
I
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
they
would
have
made
an
end
of
us
but
for
an
so
unexpected
so
unusual
that
only
the
necessity
of
rounding
my
narrative
compels
me
to
mention
it
Now
let
him
go
and
you
have
to
wait
long
for
the
right
man
for
you
to
come
along

I

Steve
was
beginning
to

the

happy

looking

Heather
he
found
a
welcome
relief
in
her

long
doleful

When
however
the
Greeks
did
learn
the
art
of
making
fireproof
from
the
Egyptians
their
cookery
made
rapid
progress
because
they
were
men
of
taste
and
intellect
A
remarkable
in
the
banquets
of
the
ancient
world
was
the
fact
that
they
did
not
confine
the
resources
of
the
table
to
the
of
one
sense
alone
Having
exhausted
their
invention
in
the
of
stimulants
for
the
palate
they
broke
fresh
ground
and
called
another
sense
to
their
aid
By
delicate
of
odours
and
distilled
perfumes
these
refined
aroused
the
fainting
appetite
and
added
a
more
exquisite
and
ethereal
enjoyment
to
the
grosser
pleasures
of
the
board
The
fication
of
the
sense
of
smelling
was
a
subject
of
no
little
importance
to
the
Romans
They
considered
flowers
as
forming
a
very
and
it
is
the
opinion
of
Bassius
that
far
exceeded
the
number
of
fruits
When
Nero
supped
in
his
Golden
House
a
mingled
shower
of
flowers
and
odorous
essences
fell
upon
him
and
one
of
the
of
was
to
smother
his
courtiers
with
flowers
Nor
was
it
entirely
as
an
object
of
luxury
that
the
ancients
made
use
of
flowers
they
were
considered
to
possess
sanative
and
medicinal
qualities
According
to
Pliny
and
others
certain
herbs
and
flowers
proved
of
sovereign
power
in
preventing
the
approaches
of
ebriety
or
as
Bassius
less
clearly
nothing
new
under
the
sun
but
regarding
foodstuffs
the
traveller
encounters
a
certain
measure
of
novelty
In
China
for
instance
dried
rats
are
esteemed
a
delicacy
The
visitor
is
told
that
they
restore
the
hair
of
the
bald
and
that
a
stewed
black
rat
will
ward
off
a
fever
A

of

Burge
Bishop
of
Southwark
asked
me
to
go
as
who
was
to
become
a
very
intimate
friend
and
I
was
solicitor
cousin
As
Bishop
Talbot
had
told
me
that
I
ought
not
to
spend
many
years
in
Tatsfield
we
held
great
family
My
eldest
brother
was
then
living
in
Limpsfield
with
his
family
and
found
a
very
suitable
house
nearby
where
my
mother
settled
and
eventually
died
in
at
the

Induction
Service
in
This
was
taken
by
the
Suffragan

of
Woolwich
a
close
friend
of
ours
We
also
had
a
little
Mission
Hall
leading
off
the
Brighton
Road
in
a
street
full
of
small
houses
This
was
called
Ellen

I

went
there

lots
of
children
there
and
we
had
a

and
an

and

district
The
motive
would
be
the
same
in
both
cases
to
serve
this
home
of
his
in
which
his
heart
lay
Here
the
rocket
charm
was
disarming
Yet
when
the
time
came
to
leave
Harry
felt
as
pressed
as
when
he
left
office
exactly
a
month
ago
If
even
Mo
statesmen
only
did
what
they
had
to
do
to
get
GO
on
an
ding
scale
and
left
the
of
their
actions
and
their
lunar
and
earthly
to
luck
In
the
first
place
it
is
not
a
great
deal
of
use
telling
even
children
as
I
have
already
suggested
not
to
be
silly
or
to
pull
themselves
together
Far
better
to
help
them
to
face
whatever
it
is
that
is
worrying
them
to
find
the
original
cause
and
then
deal
with
it

it
up

for
the
sham
it
is

many
fears
are

upon
completely
irrational
notions

may

they
say
to

us
from

even
worse
the

The
effect
of
bottom
congestion
due
to
the
light
pressure
is
inevitably
mixed
with
that
of
the
of
ground
for
spawning
Both
result
in
crowding
so
there
is
no
need
to
try
to
separate
them
thank
Heaven
A
good
picture
of
this
is
seen
on
the
miles
of
spawning
grounds
from
the
Viking
in
the
north
down
to
the
Klondykes
and
the
Reef
along
the
western
edge
of

The
East
Anglian
behaviour
see
has
always
differed
from
that
of
the
summer
fisheries
There
is
the
swim
at
slack
waters
even
in
daylight
sometimes
and
the
high
swimming
when
fish
are
caught
only
in
the
top
few
yards
of
netting
These
and
other
behaviour
mysteries
are
peculiar
to
this
fishery
which
seems
to
be
dying
out
but
a
full
discussion
of
them
is
beyond
the
present
scope
The
Theory
This
assumes
that
all
fishing
gear
when
moving
sends
before
it
a
kind
of
scaring
effect
probably
through
waves
or
vibrations
in
the
water
or
along
the
ground
Underwater
films
suggest
that
the
footrope
of
a
trawl
does
this
Films
have
also
shown

According
to
the
legend
Solomon
had
asked
the
the
Shamir
and
Ashmodeus
told
him
that
the
Shamir
had
not
been
placed
under
his
charge
as
brought
the
Shamir
to
Solomon
from
Eden
the
Paradise
the
only
place
where
the
Shamir
could
be
found
The
Talmud
describes
that
the
Shamir
lives
in
a
sanctuary
and
only
some
rare
birds
know
the
existence
of
it
These
birds
are
the
Cherubim
and
the
Seraphim
We
are
also
told
that
the
Shamir
is
the
stylus
used
by
Moses
and
this
stylus
is
described
as
a
very
precious
and
very
adamant
The
most
convenient
one
for
the
authors
has
been
the
text
of
Souter
In
this
version
of
the
text
the
Fourth
Gospel
is
printed
as
just
over
different
nouns
verbs
and
other
parts
of
speech
occurring
forms
There
are
other
texts
which
could
have
been
used
and
as
shown
in
Table
it
is
not
a
matter
of
the
greatest
importance
which
text
is
used
At
first
sight
the
difference
between
Souter
and
the
other
texts
is
rather
large
But
the
British
text
includes
the
paragraph
the
Woman
taken
in
Adultery
and
this
accounts
for
words
out
of
which
is
the
difference
between

Most
of
those
who
expound
a
theory
of
textual
take
it
for
granted
that
the
Gospel
was
written
entirely
by
one
author

it

MOST
people
would
probably
regard
tiredness
as
a
purely
physical
thing
The
cure
for
which
is
sleep
This
is
only
partly
true
Many
people
wake
up
tired
of
a
morning
and
no
amount
of
rest
seems
to
make
any
difference
Sleep
to
be
effective
must
be
of
that
quality
which
comes
Nor
is
she
being
deceitful
She
really
did
feel
tired
until
the
mind
got
the
necessary
injection
of
a
fresh
and
an
attractive
interest
Tiredness
has
therefore
as
much
to
do
with
our
mental
state
as
with
our
physical
exhaustion
A
disturbed
mind
can
bring
the
healthiest
body
to
a
sense
of
fatigue
They
wonder
why
they
get
no
rest
at
night
even
if
they
do
sleep
If
we
ever
stopped
to
consider
how
much
energy
and
time
we
lose
this
way
in
the
course
of
a
day
we
would
be
become
too
pernickety
we
could
all
probably
be
a
little
more
orderly
for
we
so
frequently

muddle

I
had
a
distinct
impression
that
the

Mrs
Caine
said
we
were
to
go
no
further
unless
and
until
we
were
sent
for
confirming
another
impression
that
became
more
and
more
definite
namely
that
she
was
in
touch
with
an
sible
source
of
authority
Among
the
natives
of
Northern
Australia
lizards
roasted
on
the
point

a

opinion

an

of

was
small
and
exquisite

I
would

if

grimly

fiercely

The
records
of

very

does
place
upon
everything
a
delicate
sentiment

Ifor

reported

Very

That
was
their
attitude
Now
if
there
been
a
good

they
could
have
measured
up
the
road
and
taken
an
interest
But
losing
a

People
were
always
losing
things
You
be
surprised
they
said
So
it
seemed
for
a
time
that
the
whole
affair
would
be
written
off
as
one
of
those
mysteries

the

Edwards

Our
position
he
said
is
somewhat
analogous
to
that
of

on
a
desert
island
Now
what
does
such
a
person
do
He
signals
his
position
by
lighting
bonfires
or
hoisting
a
flag
on
a
palm
tree
And
he
tries
to
ensure
a
supply
of
food

lighting
bonfires
on
this
bus
the
conductor
said
firmly
Contrary
to
the
the
minister
No
we
have
another
way
of
signalling
our
position
The
driver
must
sound
his

Gave
him
a

did

you

Really
Nigel
cocked
one
eyebrow
Actually
she
was
brunette
at
the
roots
and
I
had
a

on
the

arm
He
would
have
told
you
this
too
No
she
laughed
He
actually

Because
it
was

I

he
presumed
it

enquired
Now
I
wonder

I
wore

said
happily
I
shall
take
great
pleasure
in

No
he
said
after

her
again
I

This

And
the

tells
a
story
which

also
in

that
Rabbi
Eleasar
ben

said
I
am
nearly
seventy
and
I
had
not

that
Even

found
beside
the
body
which
had
at
first
been
considered
as
belonging
to
the
killer
proved
yet
another
red

for
it
was
learned
that
they
had
been
borrowed
by
Elizabeth
Camp
from
one
of
her
sisters
A
young
man
from
Reading
named
Marshall
This
man
was
known
to
have
left
his
home
on
February
and
to
have
been
away
for
four
days
Not
in
itself
a
crime
but
added
to
the
knowledge
that
he
had
gone
shopping
in
the
town
of
dford
for
a
false
moustache
it
left
him
with
something
to
join
the
Army
presumably
feeling
that
a
moustache
might
enhance
his
military
bearing
and
this
was
accepted

it

told

from

said
It
be
here
morrow
as
likely
as
not
I
paused
Miss
Jeannie
be
on
that
coach
Dan
Yes
he
said
I
know
No
harm
must
come
men
who
be
after
that
coach
I
interested
in
Johnny
I
know
But
if
lead
starts
But
I
reckon
they
be
too
busy
shooting
at
us
to
bother
with
the
coach
and
the
folks
in
it
Maybe
I
said
But
we
got
to
remember
that
girl
all
the
time
Dan
I
feel
kind
of
for
her
Of
course
he
said
giving
me
one
of
his
strange
looks
Then
he
and
have
a
look
at
the
mining
camp
working
for
as
well
as
the
townsfolk
and
the
agency
detective
With
something
of
a
start
I
remembered
the
man
who
brought
us
into
this
business
Maybe
you
know
about
Appleton
I
said
I
watched
him
because
I
was
always
fascinated
by
the
way
he
looked
when
you
tried
to
surprise
him
Dead
he
said
Yes
Dead
Shuffled
out
of
the
deck
Blasted
down
with
a
shotgun
outside
the
Palace
last
night
Fenton
or
Somers
he
said
Or
the
Town
Marshal
I
added
His
face
was
fixed
his
horse
back
off
the
trail
and
up
the
slope
leading
to
the
ridge
I
followed
From
the
top
you
could
see
something
of
the
wild
hill
country
that
lay
all
round
Gilburg
Crossing
The
air
was
fresh
and
clear
and
you
could
see
far
over
west
and
north
for
many
miles
The
real
high
country
of
the
Rockies
lifted
up
in
the
distance
like
a
pale
colour
drawing
Between
us
and
that
lay
a
vast
stretch
of
hills
canyons
buttes
and
malpais
said
Dan
If
we
head
west
we
ought
to
cut
the
trail
leading
from
Gilburg
to
the
north
So
we
swung
west
making
slow
going
over
rough
country
sliding
on
shale
climbing
down
into
draws
circling
a
big
mesa
by
a
four
or
five
mile
valley
It
got
hotter
as
the
day
wore
on
and
we
rested
gratefully
by
a
small
creek
where
we
watered
the
horses
and
drank
enough
to
cure
our
thirst
An
riding
brought
us
to
a
trail
that
We
turned
north
into
it
and
after
about
four
miles
it
led
into
a
small
canyon
which
opened
out
into
a
wide
shallow
draw
Here
in
a
we
found
the
miners
at
work
They
were
scattered
over
a
fairly
wide
area
working
singly
or
of
the
diggings
there
was
a
shack
and
as
we
got
near
someone
inside
bawled
out
If
you
come
any
closer
I
sure
blow
your
whiskers
off
Take
it
easy
mister
I
sang
got
no
whiskers
so
as
you
can
see
Just
you
go
and
tell
Nick
Dowd
we
come
to
talk
to
him
about
what
happened
last
night
whistle
then
loud
and
shrill
The
gun
barrel
peeking
out
through
a
hole
in
the
shack
never
wavered
We
sat
our
horses
waiting
Looks
as
though
they
expecting
trouble
I
said
Where
observed
Dan
shifting
about
in
his
saddle
He
was
never
long
on
patience
And
while
the
heart
is
slowly
dying
three
auricular
beats
produce
a
single
Alastair
was
a
bachelor
All
his
life
he
had
been
inclined
to
regard
women
as
something
which
must
be
to
his
career
Now
he
realised
that
he
was
entrusting
not
only
his
own
life
but
as
well
to
a
strange
girl
whom
he
had
never
met
and
on
whom
after
no
more
than
a
couple
of
telephone
calls
he
was
evening
and
I
shall
look
forward
to
meeting
you
both
at
midnight
They
might
have
been
arranging
a
supper
party
Then
she
rang
off
Alastair
admitted
that
never
in
a
not
altogether
uneventful
life
had
he
come
across
a
girl
who
sounded
so
charming
and
appeared
to
be
so
efficient
Sally
and
of
course
Mrs
Septimus
for
surely
Mr
Septimus
stood
in
the
same
case
as
myself
But
was
it
so
I
allowed
myself
to
entertain
for
an
instant
the
idea
the
would
be
and
with
the
idea
came
to
watch
Mr
Septimus
more
closely
Mrs
Caine
too
and
Mr
Gilberto
who
would
But
all
three
were
to
the
casual
I
permitted
myself
unruffled
Mr
Septimus
reserved
and
certainly
very
thoughtful
but
that
was
his
habit
Indeed
we
were
all
invaded
by
a
most
tranquil
mood
Even
the
Indian
servants
relaxed
knowing
so
Mr
Gilberto
told
us
that
the
wild
and
savage
tribes
never
approached
this
region
at
any
rate
they
remained
with
us
perhaps
for
such
protection
as
our
presence
or
Mrs
And
then
she
received
a
jolt
Old
Hubert
standing
beside
her
his
battered
hat
in
his
hand
his
toothless
mouth
stretched
in
a
wide
grin
told
her
in
halting
that
Piers
had
explained
right
at
the
start
that
Beryl
For
some
reason
the
orderlies
had
forgotten
to
switch
on
the
lights
there
was
no
colour
physical
features
were
solely
by
gradations
of
silvery
greyness
Even
the
capped
summit
of
Mont
Blanc
seven
miles
below
was
not
among
the
host
of
lower
peaks
The
screen
of
the
radar
glowed
minute
spots
flickered
across
its
surface
but
there
was
In
the
clarity
he
was
even
able
to
make
a
direct
comparison
between
the
radar
image
and
the
ground
itself
Ahead
lay
the
Plain
of
Lombardy
to
the
right
Turin
to
the
left
Milan
The
angle
of
the
scanner
could
be
adjusted
to
cover
any
particular
area
within
its
range
Geoffrey
ground
ahead
Now
as
Alastair
reduced
the
thrust
the
pitch
changed
as
the
nose
of
the
aircraft
dipped
slightly
The
needle
of
the
speed
before
coming
to
rest
at
We
a
bit
smiled
Alastair
talked
of
running
in
when
they
were
still
more
than
four
hundred
miles
from
their
And
so
the
inquest
which
had
dragged
on
with
until
April
finally
had
to
be
content
to
return
a
verdict
of
wilful
murder
against
some
person
or
persons
unknown
The
most
vital
clue
of
the
Wedgwood
have
been
very
thankful
that
the
science
of
was
only
in
its
beginnings
The
next
female
fatality
occurred
eight
years
later
yet
so
strange
were
the
that
it
was
a
further
seven
years
before
even
a
ghost
of
a
solution
emerged
There
has
always
been
something
sinister
in
the
idea
of
tunnels
The
building
of
them
was
one
of
the
most
dangerous
jobs
nected
with
railway
and
there
were
many
people
who
believed
that
to
travel
through
tunnels
would
be
an
equally
hazardous
business
Actually
the
Mishnah
quotes
two
further
proof
texts
and
the
Gemara
explains
why
these
too
are
necessary
but
a
careful
of
that
passage
makes
it
clear
that
these
are
not
quoted
here
because
they
are
not
necessary
to
prove
the
point
made
by
Joshua
Levi
Finally
we
note
that
the
comment
of
Rami
bar
Rabh
is
quoted
elsewhere
From
the
above
it
follows
that
here
once
again
we
have
a
good
of
how
a
sugya
has
been
fashioned
from
material
already
in
the
hands
of
the
Redactors
The
sugya
is
built
around
the
saying
of
Joshua
Levi
The
proof
text
for
the
reading
of
the
Book
of
Esther
is
quoted
with
the
comment
given
by
Samuel
known
comment
on
the
verse
quoted
by
Samuel
in
support
of
his
thesis
and
quoted
by
the
Gemara
in
support
of
Joshua
thesis
The
proof
text
of
greeting
by
the
divine
Name
is
taken
from
the
Mishnah
There
is
no
reference
to
the
Mishnah
here
because
the
Mishnah
deals
with
the
actual
practice
of
greeting
by
the
divine
Name
and
the
Gemara
here
quotes
the
texts
to
support
the
thesis
of
Joshua
Levi
The
question
and
answer
with
regard
to
the
need
for
the
text
of
the
angel
are
quoted
here
in
the
same
words
in
which
they
are
quoted
in
the
discussion
on
the
Mishnah
This
can
either
mean
that
both
sugyas
are
answer
or
that
our
sugya
is
quoting
from
the
longer
sugya
which
deals
with
all
four
texts
quoted
in
the
Mishnah
Or
it
is
possible
that
our
sugya
contains
the
original
question
and
answer
and
this
is
quoted
in
the
other
sugya
This
can
be
supported
by
the
accord
but
there
was
no
approval
of
his
action
expression
appears
to
have
been
framed
in
whether
the
Heavenly
Court
concurred
The
proof
text
of
bringing
the
tithe
to
the
Temple
is
then
quoted
and
the
of
the
latter
part
of
the
verse
by
Rami
bar
Rabh
is
added
not
because
this
is
at
all
relevant
a
familiar
which
had
become
so
well
known
that
it
was
invariably
quoted
whenever
the
verse
itself
was
quoted
almost
as
if
it
were
a
part
of
the
verse
The
Gemara
continues
with
a
saying
of
the
teacher
Eleazar
The
Holy
Spirit
manifested
itself
in
three
places
the
court
of
Shem
the
court
of
Samuel
of
Ramah
and
the
court
of
Solomon
The
place
of
this
on
the
saying
of
Joshua
Levi
which
deals
with
a
similar
theme
All
Aristotle
was
excited
at
the
time
not
by
the
prospect
of
the

by

might
have
had
some
weight
in
circles

much
as
In
this
cruel
process
which
was
hammering
out
nations
on

anvils

there
was
a
constant
stirring
of
those
in
authority

find
some
simple

out
of
the

always
resulted

in
the

of

for

and
offence
but
for
a
very

in

to

We
may
begin
to
understand
this
a
little
better
when
we
realize
that

itself
is
largely
in
the
mind
Very
few

to

life
without
ever
planning
to
do
so
or
in

being
conscious
of

It
is
easier
to

in

over
the
years
it
builds
up

inevitably
builds
up
tensions

As
it
is
with
so
much
of
our
life

in
a
groove
I
would
hardly
like
to
add
further
to
the
dullness
for
this
I
know
how
much
of
a
drag
it
can
be
and
I
was
interested
some
little
while
ago
to
hear
of
a
school
who
tried

Herring

It

river
has
been
the
biggest
factor
through
the
ages
in
the
constancy
of
this
great
herring
fishery
Actually
the
seine
net
has
little
or
no
cover
And
in
this
film
the
rise
of
the
fish
was
small
a
matter
of
a

two
With

It
was
naturally
a
highly
popular
victory
with
the
Londoners
but
it
brought
heavy
censure
from
nobles
who
still
believed
that
they
had
a
monopoly
of
leadership
But
at
last
Gaunt
sailed
Opposing
him

the
French
Admiral
Jean

a
great
sailor
and
an
able
strategist
Obedient
to
the
policy
of
his
King
de
Vienne
avoided
trouble
at

as
cleverly
as
Du
Guesclin
avoided
it
on
land
Gaunt
was
compelled
to
give
up
his
search
for
an
elusive
foe
and
afraid
to
return
home
without
something
to
show
he
foolishly
attempted
to
besiege
the
fortress
of
St
Malo
This
involved
the
dreary
method
of
mining
operations
in
which
Gaunt
under

Black
Prince
had

flashed
at
him
and
so
had
left
him
on
her
dignity

not

the
look
of
admiration
and
revelation
which
had
followed
her
slim
young
figure
then
regarded
the
ring

retrieved
with
some
bitterness

silent
But
she
looked
down
at

to
her
that

again
And
though
half
an
hour
ago
she
had
regarded
this
with
fortitude
it
now
filled
her
with
dismay
Quietly
she
began
to
weep

meanwhile
was
pedalling
furiously
on
the
road
Not

At
last
he
caught
up
Roberts
walking
very
dogged
towards

Afternoon
Roberts
he
called
polite
as
he
shot
past
His
spirits
were
rising
He
had
seen
no
sign
of
an
accident
Therefore
Roberts
must
have
been
mistaken
He
would
find
the
bus
safe
and
sound
in
Llangrwl
and
his
dear
Morfydd
quietly
But
awaited
him
A
restive
queue
of
people
in

station
waiting
to
be
to

a

in

Bottom
crowding
comes
when

their

this
coincides
with
the

of

many
roughs
where
the

are

it

Thus
we

film
covered
a
wide
aspect
of
the
British
to
the
European
Common
Market
Shelagh
Delaney
and
Alan
Sillitoe
attacked
education
It
was
left
to
reporter
Sevareid
to
make
the
strongest
criticisms
He
said
that
in
the
race
of
the
modern
nations
Britain
was
slipping
behind
The
daily
life
writes
the
Decalogue
which
is
written
on
two
plates
the
hard
facts
a
deep
impression
on
our
feelings
and
senses
They
make
us
the
Altar
for
God
to
emit
the
Light
which
can
be
read
in
every
language
The
Shamir
is
the
seventh
and
most
important
creature
that
was
created
on
Sabbath
real
peace
to
the
whole
world
diligently
unto
my
which
I
command
you
this
day
to
love
the
Lord
your
God
and
to
serve
Him
with
all
your
heart
and
with
all
is
something
deficient
So
they
proceeded
to
see
if
the
coast
was
clear
The
street
was
quiet
and
nor
sound
of
flying
saucers
So
they
ventured
forth
and
made
their
way
on
foot
to
house
Dan
came
to
the
door
at
their
ring
but
neglected
to
offer
any
greeting
He
was
deeply
and
it
seemed
that
the
ringing
of
a
doorbell
was
to
him
a
new
and
strange
phenomenon
Gay
went
out
to
the
waiting
taxi
and
then
found
that
in
the
excitement
of
meeting
Gavin
she
had
left
her
glasses
on
the
veranda
She
went
quickly
back
to
fetch
them
Gavin
and
the
girl
who
had
got
off
the
plane
with
him
were
talking
He
was
writing
something
in
his
with
a
sick
feeling
of
despair
Gay
knew
that
of
course
had
had
a
thoroughly
good
time
and
it
would
take
them
nearly
to
next
week
to
settle
down
again
Meanwhile
Hubert
would
have
betaken
himself
and
his
look
as
though
it
was
only
what
you
expected
of
me
and
his
pals
down
A
precaution
for
there
was
no
other
car
abroad
and
no
pedestrian
to
cross
his
path
nor
to
wait
at
an
for
the
light
to
change
At
his
apartment
he
garaged
his
car
and
then
stood
loses
its
beat
in
death
about
serious
things
like
be
such
a
baby
They
were
going
Hardly
likely
my
sweet
surgery
goes
on
for
hours
If
they
get
in
before
even
though
they
standing
on
one
toes
I
give
you
a
ring
she
had
replied
readily
So
how
could
Nigel
have
been
at
the
Load
of
Trouble
roadhouse
very
evening
But
we
Stop
your
stupid
talk
woman
We
are
Be
silent

and

Band
Appa
Bondi
said
things
we
will
tell
you
All
who
make
the
journey
from
the
Heavy
World
become
changed
Some
die
Most
live
and
grow
wings
Between
the
worlds
are
many
strong
When
you
come
here
when
you
come
to
the
True
tigerfly
is
not
a
tigerfly
until
it
changes
So
humans
change
I
cannot
know
what
he
says
Haris
said
stubbornly
throwing
himself
down
But
and
Flor
were
listening
it
dies
when
it
changes
into
a
tigerfly
You
are
still
young
said
the
Chief
Captive
You

In

had
heedlessly
thrown
down
their

on
his
It
was
You
see
You
needed
them
no
more
You
are
still
young
You
may
be
able
to
have
babies
Some
of
those
babies
may
be
born
with
wings
The
Captive
with
the
boneless
arms
added
Some
may
be
born
wrong
as
we
are
Some
may
be
born
right
You
are
too
foul
to
live
Haris
growled
Why
are
you
not
killed
Because
we
know
all
things
the
Chief
Captive
said
Suddenly
his
second
head
roused
itself
and
declared
To
be
a
good
shape
is
not
all
in
life
To
know
is
also
good
Because
we
cannot
move
well
we
can
think
This
tribe
of
the
True
World
So
it
lets
us
rule
it
Flor
and
muttered
together
Do
you
say
that
you
poor
at
last
We
do
Then
why
are
you
captives
The
flyman
with
ear
lobes
and
thumbs
connected
making
his
perpetual
little
gesture
of
protest
spoke
for
the
first
time
To
rule
is
to
serve
woman
Those
who
bear
power
are
slaves
to
it
Only
an
outcast
is
free
Because
we
are
Captives
we
have
the
time
to
talk
and
think
and
plan
and
know
Those
who
know
command
the
knives
of
others
No
hurt
will
come
to
you
Band
Appa
Bondi
added
You
will
live
among
us
and
enjoy
your
life
free
from
harm
No
the
Chief
Captive
said
with
both
mouths
Before
she
can
enjoy
and
her
companion
Flor
this
other
man
creature
is
plainly
useless
must
help
our
great
plan
The
invasion
Bondi
and
its
savage
life
are
still
fresh
in
you
We
need
such
memories
So
we
ask
you
to
go
back
there
on
a
great
plan
we
have
Go
back
gasped
Flor
Yes
We
plan
to
attack
the
Heavy
World
You
must
help
to
lead
our
force
The
long
afternoon
of
eternity
wore
on
that
long
golden
road
of
an
afternoon
that
would
somewhere
lead
to
night
Motion
there
was
but
motion
without
event
except
for
those
negligible
events
that
seemed
so
large
to
the
creatures
in
them
For
Flor
and
Haris
there
were
many
events
Chief
of
these
was
that
they
learned
to
fly
properly
The
pains
associated
with
their
wings
soon
died
away
as
the
wonderful
new
flesh
and
tendon
To
sail
up
in
the
light
gravity
became
an
increasing
delight
the
ugly
flopping
movements
of
flymen
on
the
Heavy
World
had
no
place
here
None
of
these
classes
except
the
yeomen
paid
or
expected
to
pay
direct
taxes
During
the
teenth
century
the
methods
of
financing
the
Exchequer
had
become
stabilized
When
the
King
and
his
Council
required
nal
funds
they
were
usually
granted
an
export
tax
on
the
wool
trade
collected
by
means
of
that
staple
system
which
ensured
that
prices
quality
and
tax
could
be
pervised
and
controlled
together
with
a
There
were
two
other
sources
of
public
revenue
first
the
Church
which
wisely
followed
the
lead
of
the
Commons
and
in
its
own
the
foreign
merchants
with
whom
the
officials
had
formerly
made
private
bargains
payments
were
now
authorized
by
sanction
at
a
rate
roughly
fifty
per
cent
in
excess
of
the
rate
for
native
merchants
In
addition
to
these
revenues
the
King
had
the
financial
benefits
of
his
position
at
the
head
of
the
feudal
system
as
its
chief
landowner
and
the
recipient
of
the
fines
of
royal
justice
It
was
therefore
a
and
not
very
financial
system
in
which
the
borders
between
private
and
public
purse
were
and
national
war
and
in
which

vely

the
feudal

an
love
of

and
these
young
ones
on

for
jobs
which
they
putting
their
best
foot
forward
understand
knowing
that
Gay
was
as
much
ashamed
for
Gavin
at
the
way
he
was
behaving
as
she
was
hurt
for
herself
There
can
be
little
doubt
that
if
the
Thetans
discover
our
mental
they
will
promptly
give
us
their
hypnotic
treatment
If
we
can
avoid
undue
prominence
it
may
be
that
we
can
move
about
pretty
freely
without
detection
If
we
can
well
then
we

What
those
interests
are
beyond
personal
security

clue
but
who
knows
When
he
finally
beckoned
to
them
to
enter
the
action
gave
the
impression
of
having
been
thought
out
and

Even
more
simply
test
your
own
reactions
to
different
situations
There
are
some
which
bring
on
an
almost
immediate
feeling
of
tiredness
such
as
when
your
wife
mentions
refer
to
something
you
like
doing

a
veritable
surge
of
energy
Many
a
girl
who
up
with
no
apparent
tiredness
at
all
when
her
boy

calls
and

for
a
long
walk
In
the
days
when
most
people
were
born
lived
and
died
within
the
boundaries
of
the
village
it
was
not
difficult
for
anybody
to
live
a
day
at
a
time
Even
those
who
held
a
high
and
office
lived
in
far
greater
simplicity
than
their
successors
When

from
the
Continent
took

The
only
concession
made
in
view
of
the
objections
to
the
first
two
was
the
suggestion
that
the
rich
should
help
the
poor
but
this
was
only
a
pious
hope
because
no
machinery
was
provided
for
carrying
it
into
effect
and

Soon
they
were
good
enough
to
sing
at
meetings
One
of
the
helpful
was
that
they
were
able
to
obtain
some
and
Red
Flag
badge
thus
presenting
a
much
better
appearance
Later
on
many
a
sunny
Sunday
evening
when
George
went
to
speak
at
Malin
Bridge
they
would
be
there
to
begin
the
meeting
But
privately
he
turned
out
to
be
as
friendly
as
Wise
the
tube
to
have
the
same
adolescent
openness
and
freshness
though
perhaps
not
the
same
maturity
One
remembered
that
he
was
a
lawyer
by
training
and
suspected
that
the
points
he
made
so
sharply
in
politics
were
as
abstract
to
him
as
those
a
lawyer
makes
in
a
court
of
law
A
study
also
opens
up
in
the
dietary
welcomed
by
men
of
genius
as
well
as
the
foods
for
which
they
have
had
an
aversion
Shelley
for
example
had
a
great
contempt
for
animal
food
believing
that
it
impaired
the
faculties
breakfast
and
supper
consisted
of
a
piece
of
coarse
bread
and
a
bowl
of
milk
Dante
Gabriel
Rossetti
had
simple
tastes
in
food
At
one
dinner
he
is
said
to
have
been
blind
to
the
charms
of
turbot
and
to
have
been
much
more
interested
in
the
on
the
table
cloth
to
examine
the
marks
on
the
back
without
going
through
the
formality
of
having
his
turbot
removed
first
Wagner
was
a
highly
practical
feeder
He
ate
very
fast
placing
his
food
in
his
mouth
and
gulping
it
down
as
he
talked
Brigham
Young
would
make
a
dinner
on
tripe
which
he
washed
down
with
beer
A
writer
who
had
dinner
with
Dickens
says
the
menu
was
Whitstable
oysters
a
brown
sole
a
baked
leg
of
mutton
with
oyster
veal
stuffing
and
a
gin
punch
The
same
man
went
to
see
Carlyle
and
after
mentioning
that
he
had
dined
with
Longfellow
told
the
sage
a
very
funny
story
which
made
Carlyle
absolutely
laugh
but
all
the
Chelsea
did
in
return
was
to
ask
if
his
guest
would
have
a
cup
of
tea
to
Douglas
Kinnaird
saying
that
it
was
incorrect
throughout
He
had
no
sooner
heard
from
Count
Gamba
and
Fletcher
that
Byron
would
have
wished
his
body
to
return
to
England
than
that
course
was
carried
into
effect
not
in
spite
of
himself
and
Sir
Frederick
Stoven
but
with
their
perfect
currence
while
General
Adam
was
at
Corfu
the
whole
time
and
never
interfered
in
the
slightest
degree
about
the
matter
There
were
few
passengers
on
the
plane
and
Gavin
was
quickly
through
the
customs
Gay
Gavin
The
girl
and
her
luggage
had
and
they
were
alone
together
The
porter
brought
bag
out
to
the
hand
and
smiled
I
want
to
check
up
on
the
flights
back
He
rose
from
his
bench
and
came
into
the
livingroom
where
Heather
and
Steve
stood
aghast
at
his
entrance
He
came
almost
falling
forward
in
an
ungainly
shuffle
neck
thrust
out
arms
dangling
loosely
Then
abruptly
he
drew
himself
up
and
walked
on
the
very
tips
of
his
toes
He
stretched
his
arms
great
breaths
that
word
shouted
into
her
very
soul
a
horn
of
warning
and
with
it
was
coupled
a
fragment
of
seen
in
Farlingham
on
an
occasion
he
had
sworn
he
had
been
standing
in
for
Luke
Parsons
at
his
surgery
in
Little
Phelpham
But
this
time
there
was
a
very
attempt
to
apply
a
sliding
scale
to
the
payments
demanded
The
definition
of
an
adult
was
altered
to
read
over
sixteen
and
where
the
poorest
were
to
pay
a
groat
the
Duke
of
Lancaster
and
the
of
Canterbury
and
York
were
to
pay
ten
marks
and
between
these
two
extremes
a
graduated
scale
of
payments
was
fixed
for
the
different
classes
of
laymen
and
clerics
Again
the

not

It
seems
obvious
that
though
the

of
yeomen
could
pierce
the
plate
and

of
French
knights
a
brilliant
battle
was
no
substitute
for

policy
and
that

had
no

became
mere

And
Dai
on

knowing
in
his

that
Morfydd
was

as
surely
as
she
was

the

set
out
for

But
it

Somewhere
on
those
fifteen
miles
of
mountain
roads
it
from
the
earthly
scene
The
first
intimation
that
all
was
not
well
came
when
a
Isaiah
Roberts
landlord
of
The
Joy
rang
up
the
Dinas
Motor
Omnibus
to
ask
what
had
happened
to
their
damn

Start

People

And
what

that
there

It
is
said
that
there
is
nothing
new
under
the
sun
but
regarding
foodstuffs
the
traveller
encounters
a
certain
measure
of
novelty
a
delicacy
The
visitor
is
told
that
they
restore
the
hair
of
the

that
a
stewed

Against
these
advantages
the
codex
was
fragile
and
might
be
bulky
It
is
sometimes
possible
to
tell
whether
or
not
a
particular
text
was
written
on
a
roll
or
a
codex
Rolls
were
prepared
for
writing
but
any
papyrus
left
unused
at
the
end
could
be
cut
off
If
the
text
was
longer
than
the
roll
a
sheet
could
easily
be
glued
on
The
verso
of
the
roll
was
blank
and
one
cannot
think
of
an
author
Mark
for
example
sending
out
his
Gospel
lacking
the
ending
while
one
whole
side
of
his
roll
was
unused
The
codex
form
was
not
so
Even
in
the
case
of
the
quire
an
extra
sheet
glued
on
might
have
to
be
gummed
on
over
the
binding
or

One
can
remember
with
horror
the
pictures
of
the
and
complete
with
heavy
crochet
piece
covers
with
a
fringing
of
clumsy
bobbles
and
numerous
other
crocheted
pieces
It
was
some
years
after
the
Victorian
period
that
designers
realised
the
of
the
craft
and
crochet
was
revived
with
designs
suitable
for
trends
Crochet
today
has
a
variety
of
uses
and
has
even
stepped
into
the
field
of
high
fashion
It
was
the
battered
and
broken
body
of
a
woman
He
sent
word
straight
away
to
Merstham
Station
and
a
stretcher
party
took
the
body
to
the
Feathers
Hotel
to
await
Was
it
a
case
of
suicide
where
some
unhappy
soul
had
walked
into
the
blackness
and
into
the
path
of
some
train
This
hardly
seemed

found
to
have
her
own
silk
scarf
drawn
almost
tight
enough
to
strangle
her
and
the
ends
Both
her
wrists
bore
the
marks
of
severe
bruising
and
there
were
other
injuries
on
her
body
which
had
occurred
before
her
death
was
ensured
by
some
train
which
had
roared
through
the
tunnel
There
were
no
letters
or
papers
found
on
her
to
assist
identi
fication
no
money
and
no
railway
ticket
By
then
reports
were
being
gathered
about
all
traffic
over
this
stretch
of
line
but
no
was
about
any
carriage
with
an
open
door
nor
any
passenger
reporting
an
incident
which
might
relate

a
quick
shift
of

and
at
the
same
time
jibbing
the
boom
to
which
he
had
the
stay

fastened
Bill
made
the
yawl
recover
It
seemed
to
the
frightened
judge
as
though
his
son
would
actually
shoot
the
craft
in
under
the
outer
end
of
the
wharf
But
by
pressing
the
tiller
hard
over
and
at
the
same
time
dropping
the
small
sheet
of
wet
canvas
Bill
cleared
the
corner
of
the
pier
by
inches
and
with
the
tiller
still
hard
over
brought
the
yawl
up
against

in

the

It

this
dictum
Suffice
to
say
that
few
of
us
stop
to
marvel
at
the
progress
of
which

How
many
centuries
ago
in
some
cave
or
hilly
hide
did
our
forebears
home
from
the
chase
hold
forth
from
a
spear
the
welcome
gobbet
of
meat
or
fish
burnt
and
roasted
in
the
homely
and
protecting
flame
How
many
centuries
later
did
the
mercenary
in
the
Roman
wars
thus
impale
on

or
lance
his

Later
came

And
if
certain
dishes
and
modes
of
food
have
persisted
down
the
ages
the
motive
that
preserved
always
been
strong
in
mankind
The
sharing
of
a
meal
in
those
earliest
dangerous
days
was
an
admittance
into
an
far
more
important
than
the
casual
meetings
of
the
present
day
the
desire
to
share
something
more
intimate
than
mere
converse
has
always
been
there
In
Chapter
Two
he
gauged
the
nature
of
the
movements
from
the
dissection
of
living
animals
showing
how
these
ments
alternate
with
rests
and
are
seen
best
in
cold
animals
or
in
flagging
warmer
ones
At

with
all
his
colleagues
he
has
not
until
now
been
able
to
exhibit
exactly
how
this
was
effected
nor
has
he
been
able
to
explain
the

by
showing
that
such

of

and
coherent
plan
To
understand
how
this
is
possible
it
is
necessary
to
examine
the
text
of
the
Gospel
THE
Fourth
Gospel
was
almost
certainly
written
in
Greek
A
modern
text
of
the
Gospel
represents
the
work
of
of
scholars
who
have
compared
the
many
scripts
of
John
and
worked
out
the
version
which
is
most
likely
to
have
been
the
original
wording
It
is
not
possible
to
establish
any
one

with
absolute
precision
